# Headroom

**<https://headroom.zoller.ai/>**

Work out which open-weight LLMs run on your hardware, and how comfortably — across discrete
GPUs, unified-memory machines, and CPU+RAM.

Most VRAM calculators sort hardware by one number and apply one KV-cache formula to every
model. Both shortcuts break on the machines and models people actually care about. Hardware is
a **capacity / bandwidth / compute triangle**: a DGX Spark holds 128 GB at 273 GB/s and prefills
fast but decodes slowly; a Mac Studio M3 Ultra is the inverse; an RTX 5090 is quick at
everything inside 32 GB. And the naive `2 × layers × kv_heads × head_dim` formula overstates
DeepSeek-family models by several times (MLA caches one compressed latent per layer, ~70 KB per
token) and roughly doubles anything with sliding-window layers. At long context those errors are
tens of gigabytes — the difference between "buy another GPU" and "you're fine".

So Headroom computes rather than approximates. Model architectures come from each repo's own
`config.json` on Hugging Face and exact parameter counts from its safetensors index, so weights
and KV are derived per model instead of guessed from a size class. Throughput is a roofline
calibrated against published measurements at both ends of the hardware range, and it reports
prefill and decode separately, because a machine can be strong at one and weak at the other.

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

```ts
import { evaluate } from '@/engine';

const { placement, decode, prefill } = evaluate({
  model: GPT_OSS_120B,
  quant: getQuant('mxfp4'),
  usage: { contextTokens: 32768, concurrency: 4, kvPrecision: 'q8' },
  rig: { device: DGX_SPARK, count: 1 },
  runtime: LLAMA_CPP,
});

placement.fits; // does it load at all
decode.perUserTokensPerSec; // how fast it feels
prefill.ttftSeconds; // how long before the first token
```

## Development

```
npm test                        # unit and component tests, in jsdom
npm run test:e2e                # Playwright; builds and serves on 127.0.0.1:4173 itself
npm run lint                    # eslint
npm run format                  # prettier
npm run catalog -- --dry-run    # re-derive the model catalog from Hugging Face, writing nothing
```

Current status and what's next: [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

The engine under `src/engine/` is pure — no React imports — so it can be pinned to published
reference values. Those tests are the point: `src/engine/*.test.ts` asserts against llama.cpp's
published 4.58 GiB for Llama 3.1 8B at Q4_K_M, DeepSeek's stated KV footprint, and measured
throughput on a DGX Spark and an EPYC 9654. Treat a failure there as the numbers being wrong, not
the test.

`e2e/` covers only what jsdom structurally cannot — layout, scrolling, coarse-pointer media
queries, canvas actually painting, and text scaled to 200%. That boundary is deliberate rather
than tidy: the gap shipped a real bug once, and the specs there carry the reasoning.

`npm run build` prerenders. After the client bundle it builds an SSR one and runs
[`scripts/prerender.ts`](scripts/prerender.ts), which renders each route in
[`src/data/routes.ts`](src/data/routes.ts) to `dist/<route>/index.html` with that scenario's real
figures in the markup, writes `sitemap.xml`, and copies the un-prerendered shell to `dist/404.html`.
199 pages today: the root, `/<device>/` for every device, `/m/<model>/` for every model, and
`/<device>/<model>/` for the ten most-downloaded models against twelve machines spread across the
three hardware classes. The same route list is read in the browser, so a visitor landing on
`/rtx-5090/` gets the RTX 5090 rather than a page that renders one thing and hydrates another.
Query URLs are unchanged and always win over a path.

The model catalog is generated, never typed. `npm run catalog` rewrites
`src/data/models.generated.json` from each repo's own `config.json` and safetensors index, and a
[scheduled job](.github/workflows/catalog-refresh.yml) runs it weekly and opens a pull request when
a figure actually moves. Corrections belong in that script's seed list, with a written reason —
not in the JSON.
