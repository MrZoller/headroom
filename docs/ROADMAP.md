# Roadmap

Where Headroom stands, what's left, and the decisions that would be expensive to re-derive.

This file exists because the working plan lived outside the repo and would have been lost.
Keep it current: it is the handoff document between sessions, and the place to look before
re-litigating a settled question.

## The thesis

Most VRAM calculators sort hardware by one number and apply one KV-cache formula to every
model. Both shortcuts break on the machines and models people actually care about. Headroom
computes rather than approximates, and reports **capacity, decode speed, and time-to-first-token
as three separate answers** rather than collapsing them into "will it fit".

Three things are the moat, in order:

1. **KV cache dispatches on attention family.** MLA (DeepSeek) caches one compressed latent per
   layer — no factor of two, no head multiplier, ~70 KB/token where the naive formula predicts
   several times that. Sliding-window layers (gpt-oss, Gemma) stop growing past their window,
   halving gpt-oss-120b's KV at 128K.
2. **The catalog is derived, never typed.** Architectures come from each repo's `config.json`,
   parameter counts from its safetensors index.
3. **The answer is a decision, not a number.** "3.2 tok/s" means nothing; "unusable for a coding
   agent, fine for overnight batch" is what people want. Built: seven workload archetypes, each
   graded at the prompt it really sends. The hard part turned out not to be the thresholds but
   making every verdict state the bar it missed — see **Verdicts**, below.

## Status

**All eight phases are done, and the site is live** at
<https://mrzoller.github.io/bench/> as of 28 July 2026, and at
<https://mrzoller.github.io/headroom/> once the rename below lands. The repository went public to
get there — Pages is not available on a private repo without a paid plan — which also restored the
branch ruleset that had been convention rather than enforcement since the start.

**The project is Headroom now, and the half that is not in any commit is what to watch** (#176).
Everything inside the repository says so as of 3 August 2026 — package name, wordmark, page title,
the live URL it advertises, and every `github.com/MrZoller/…` link outside `CHANGELOG.md`, whose
entries are history and were left alone. What is left is a repository rename and one repository
variable, **in that order**, and neither is in the pull request: the URL above answers only once
`MrZoller/bench` has become `MrZoller/headroom`. **Deployment**, below, is where the order and the
window between the two steps are written down.

**Lowercase `headroom` was left alone everywhere, and that is the rule rather than an oversight.**
It is a real quantity in this codebase — leftover VRAM, the margin over a threshold, the slack in a
test timeout — and it means that in `placement.ts`, in the verdict copy and in `vite.config.ts`'s
timeout rationale exactly as it did before the rename. The product name is capitalised for the same
reason: `Headroom packed 9,9,9,9 layers` and `2x headroom over the observed worst case` are
different words, and case is what keeps them from having to be told apart by context. The hero
surface is still **the Bench** — a workbench, a sibling of the Envelope and the Matrix rather than
the product's namesake — so `Bench.tsx`, `#bench-detail` and "the cell the Bench above is set to"
are all unchanged.

**The v2 guided-mode milestone is done too**, closed 1 August 2026. Launch commands, detect,
recommend and calibrate shipped in one pass as five pull requests — #163 and #173 for launch, #167
for recommend, #168 for detect, #169 for calibrate — and what each turned out to settle is under
**v2 — guided mode**, below. Six findings were filed rather than patched under the merge rule, and
two more (#180, #181) came out of reviewing _this section_ a day later; they are in **Open
questions**, and two of the first six share one root.

What remains is a naming decision, **one open issue, and it is work** — the six filed
during the pass, less [#165](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/165),
[#166](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/166),
[#170](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/170),
[#171](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/171) and
[#172](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/172), which are fixed, and the two that came out
of reviewing this very document — [#180](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/180), fixed
5 August 2026 and recorded under **Launch commands** below, since what it settled is where the
benchmark measures from, and [#181](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/181), fixed the same
day and recorded under **Calibrate**, since what it settled is how the output of that benchmark is
read back — and [#182](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/182), the half of #165 that its
own verification note said not to fold in, fixed 5 August 2026 and recorded under **Open questions**
below, since what it settled is which device holds the tensors no layer holds. #174 is closed as a
record of a decision already made rather than as a task. What remains is
**two loose ends that are on `main` and in no issue at all**: a `LLAMA_KV_TYPES`
mapping duplicated between `Calibrate.tsx` and `launch.ts` under a comment saying the two must be
merged once both land, and the emitted `llama-bench` command asking for `-o md` while the parser
prefers JSON. Both are described under **Calibrate**, below, and both are named here because a
handoff summary that enumerates reads as a complete inventory. The
naming decision is the smallest of the three: the site serves from the Pages project URL, and a
zoller.ai subdomain is one repository variable away. See **Deployment**, below.

**The site now serves real HTML, on 199 routes** ([#178](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/178),
Phases 2 and 3). `npm run build` renders the root, `/<device>/` for all 43 devices, `/m/<model>/`
for all 35 models, and `/<device>/<model>/` for the ten most-downloaded models against twelve
machines spread 6/4/2 across the hardware classes — each file carrying its own figures, the memory
breakdown, prefill and decode, against 860 bytes of empty shell before it. **163 MiB of `dist/` and
+5.7 s of build time** (2.5 s → 8.2 s), against caps of 400 routes and 512 MiB that both fail the
build loudly and name the tier that crossed them. `sitemap.xml` is generated from the same
`prerenderRoutes()` the pages are, so the two cannot drift; it lists 188 of the 199, because the
one rumoured device gets a page and no invitation to it. The route list is derived in
`src/data/routes.ts` — no device id or model id is written down in it — and read by both the
prerenderer and the browser, so the pages that get built and the scenario a visitor lands on cannot
disagree. What the two phases settled is under **Things that took real work to get right**, and the
finding worth reading first is that the plan's injection seam was wrong in a way that produced four
correct-looking files with one machine's numbers in all of them.

**Those pages no longer repeat the cross-catalog Matrix**
([#195](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/195)). The server and the client's hydration
snapshot both omit it; after React attaches to that matching tree, `useSyncExternalStore` switches to
the client snapshot and mounts the unchanged Matrix. This is the seam that matters: rendering the
Matrix on the client's first pass would be a hydration mismatch and would throw away the selected
scenario HTML that prerendering exists to preserve. A non-prerendered fallback uses `createRoot` and
reads the client snapshot immediately, so it still gets the Matrix on its first render.

Measured on 16 August 2026, the root page fell from **840,127 to 51,429 raw bytes** and from
**37,509 to 11,043 gzip bytes**; the whole `dist/` tree fell from **165,336 to 10,776 KiB**. The raw
HTML still carries the selected device-model capacity verdict, memory budget and breakdown, prefill,
and decode figures. Only the 1,470-cell comparison repeated on every route moved client-side. Unit
hydration tests fail on any recoverable mismatch, the browser test checks both the raw response and
the post-hydration Matrix, and the existing Matrix Playwright suite still measures its final geometry.

**Correctness debt is tracked as issues, not here.** #9 and #10, which graded a configuration as
working when it is not, are fixed — together with #11, which printed a figure measured at a
different scenario from the one its sentence described. Filed as three bugs, one class; written up
under **Verdicts** below. Both engine bugs are fixed: the layer-split spill fraction (#14) and
prefill having no notion of a cached prefix (#23); see **Engine** below. The browser-level test gap
(#19) is closed, and with it the legend overflow (#34) that only a browser could falsify; see
**Tests** below. Reflow at 200% text (#35) and the coarse-pointer targets (#29) are fixed, both by
sweeping the class rather than the named instance. The labelling (#13) and clipboard (#15) bugs
turned out to have been fixed in passing by #25 and #26 and were closed on the evidence.

### The post-release sweep, 29–31 July 2026

Eighteen issues filed against the live site, worked as one pass and merged as eighteen pull requests.
Most are written up in the sections below where they change a derivation; what follows is what the
_shape_ of the sweep taught, because that part is not visible from any single diff.

**Every issue named a subset of its class, and the ones that hurt were the ones I swept badly.** This
file already recorded that pattern three times; the sweep added five more. The Apple GPU-bin defect
was filed against one row and was live on four. The pointer-reclaim fix on the Matrix readout landed
on the cell handler and left both heading handlers with the identical bug. A candidate-report fix
taught the failed-fetch path to admit failure and left the capped-walk path publishing an
ordinary-looking table. In each case the reviewer named instance _n_ and the class was _n + 2_, and
in each case the second round was more expensive than sweeping would have been.

**A review round costs less than it looks and converges slower than it looks.** Codex found real
defects on every round of every PR; across the sweep exactly one premise was false, and even that one
had a true half. But three PRs took four and five rounds, and rounds three onward were almost
entirely defects in the _previous round's fix_ — a gate that fixed a dead control and created a trap
door, a reservation that fixed the panel and moved the page. `ROADMAP.md`'s existing rule (merge on
green CI, triage and file the rest) is what stops that; six issues were filed under it rather than
patched, and each carries its measurement so the next session does not re-derive it.

**Catalog growth is a load-bearing input to the test suite, and nothing was watching it.** The Matrix
is models × devices, so #78 and #77 together took it from 408 cells to 1,470 and the unit suite from
42s to about fourteen minutes — 3.6× the cells for 20× the wall clock, because `userEvent` slows
superlinearly with tree size. Two separate pull requests failed CI on a per-test timeout for changes
that touched no component, and each was diagnosed from scratch. The timeout has now been raised twice
and must not be raised a third time; see #101.

**The grid is _shipping_ devices, not catalog rows, and every count of it has to say so.** The first
draft of this paragraph multiplied 35 models by all 43 rows and reported 1,505 — but `Matrix.tsx`
filters on `status === 'shipping'`, so the rumoured M5 Ultra has never been a column and the true
products are 17 × 24 = 408, 17 × 42 = 714 and 35 × 42 = 1,470. The error is invisible at a glance
because both series grow the same way, and it is the same shape as every other figure in this file
that was derived from the wrong denominator: the number came from the catalog, and what the reader
needed came from the surface.

The same three numbers were live in two other places, which is the usual shape: the issue body of
#101, corrected in a comment there, and the timeout rationale in `vite.config.ts` — the one place a
maintainer is sent to read them, and the one this file tells them not to raise again. That copy is
corrected on the #101 branch rather than here, because it sits three lines from the timeout that
change also lowers the pressure on; until that merges the repository holds both readings, and this
paragraph is the record of which one is right.

**Codex needs a nudge here, and the ROADMAP's "~40 minutes" reads as patience when it is absence.**
Every clean verdict in the sweep arrived within about two minutes of an `@codex review` comment, and
several PRs sat 30 to 60 minutes with no reaction and no verdict before being nudged. The last one
bounds it: #107 sat **27 hours** on a green, thread-free head with no verdict of any kind, then
answered a nudge in two and a half minutes. And the connector was provably healthy the whole time —
it cleared #106 three minutes _before_ that push and #104 and #105 two hours before, so the silence
was specific to one push rather than a backlog. A silent push is not a queue position, and waiting
longer does not help. Treat a quiet half-hour as a skipped push rather than a slow one — one nudge per
push, per `watch-pr`.

**A 👍 from the connector is a clean verdict, and this file said otherwise for a week.** Checks
green plus 👍 plus no unresolved threads means the PR is ready to merge, with no posted review to
wait for. Do not nudge a 👍. The rule this replaces — "a reaction is not a verdict, and 👀 is the
only one that means a run is in flight" — was generalised from #107 and cost a real merge: #183 sat
waiting for a comment that was never going to come, because its 👍 was read as the signature of a
skipped push. Chris settled it on 2 August 2026, and settled it in the broad form deliberately.

The mechanism that makes it safe is the reaction's `created_at`, which must postdate the head
commit. That is what distinguishes #183 from #107 in practice: on #186 the 👍 landed three minutes
after the push it was answering. It is not a guarantee — GitHub's reaction content for 👍 **is**
`+1`, so the two are one signal rather than two, and #107 carried exactly that reaction with no 👀,
no review and no comment while genuinely unreviewed for 27 hours. Under this rule #107 would have
been merged unreviewed. That trade is accepted knowingly: the alternative reading stalls every clean
PR behind a comment the connector often does not post.

When there is no reaction at all, the question is still "has _this head_ been reviewed" rather than
"has the bot touched this PR" — ask it against both the reviews API and the issue comments, and
compare the SHA as a prefix, since the no-findings form abbreviates it to ten characters. #107
remains the case for the nudge timing above; it is no longer a detection rule about reactions.

**The tooling gaps were worktree-shaped.** Running agents in git worktrees needs a symlinked
`node_modules`, and `.gitignore` listed `node_modules/` with a trailing slash — which matches a
directory and not a symlink of that name, so `git add -A` staged the link. Worse, each worktree
carries its own `tsconfig.json`, so `npm run lint` reported 936 parse errors across the real `src/`
tree and `vitest` collected 22 copies of `App.test.tsx` and reported 44 failures belonging to another
checkout. Both are fixed in `.gitignore`, `eslint.config.js` and `vite.config.ts`; the general lesson
is that a nested checkout is invisible to a human and not to a tool that walks the tree.

**Cleaning up afterwards needs GitHub, because neither git command for "is this branch merged" works
against a squash merge.** The repo squash-merges, so a merged branch's tip is not an ancestor of
`main` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` reports every one of them unmerged. `git cherry` fails the
same way for a subtler reason, and _conditionally_, which is worse: the squash commit's patch is the
_union_ of the branch's commits, so on a branch of two or more no individual commit has a matching
patch-id and every one reports `+`. A one-commit branch is the exception — its patch and the squash's
are the same patch, so `git cherry` correctly reports `-`. That is the trap rather than the escape: a
rule verified on the one-commit case and then applied to the rest looks like it works. Both failing
answers read as "unmerged work you are about to delete", which is the answer that stops a cleanup. The
test that actually holds, on branches of any length, is matching the local tip against the merged PR's
`headRefOid` — GitHub squashed
exactly that commit, so identity there is proof and nothing local can substitute for it.

MLX's 8-bit KV cache (#33) is **derived rather than marked**: `mlx-lm`'s source states the group
size and the scale-plus-bias dtypes, so the width is 8.5 bits and the catalog says so (#38). That
forced the contract question the marker always carried (#45) — the field asks whether a width is
_established_ now, not whether it is nominal.

### The copy pass, and the class it actually found, 3 August 2026

[#177](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/177) asked for three phases over the UI copy —
inventory, mechanics, voice — on the premise that a lot of it "reads like it was written by an LLM".
**That premise no longer holds, and the evidence is worth recording so the question is not reopened
from the issue text.** A sweep of every user-facing string under `src/` and in `index.html` — 259 of
them across 24 files, covering JSX text, string constants, `aria-label`s, captions, placeholders,
option notes and the meta description — returns **zero** hits for the banned vocabulary: no
_powerful_, _seamless_, _robust_, _comprehensive_, _intuitive_, _effortless_; no
leverage/empower/unlock/streamline; no "It's not just X, it's Y"; no "Whether you're X or Y"; no
emoji. There are no double spaces, no missing spaces after punctuation and no doubled terminal
stops anywhere in the copy. The eighteen-issue sweep above and the v2 pass had already taken it.

**What a real inventory finds instead is grammar that only breaks on some data**, which is a class
no amount of reading the source catches — every one of these renders correctly at the default
scenario. Three sentences put an indefinite article in front of an interpolation and let the value
decide which article is right. `Your browser reports a ${vendor} GPU.` in `detect.ts` is the sharp
one: `vendorFromString` returns NVIDIA, AMD, Intel or Apple and every one of the four wants "an", so
the string was wrong on **every value it can hold**, on the most common path through the detection
panel. Its sibling reads a WebGPU adapter architecture, where `ampere` and the `xe-*` family want
"an" and `blackwell` and `gcn-1` want "a". `calibrate.ts`'s Metal mismatch is the same shape against
the catalog's own vendors: its branch is guarded on the prediction _not_ being Apple, so 32 of the
43 rows reach it and it was wrong on 31 of those — `desktop-ddr5-dual-channel`, whose vendor is
`Generic`, is the only row the article was right for. The fix is to move the article in front of the
noun, where the interpolation cannot reach it — "a GPU from NVIDIA", "a GPU on ampere", "for NVIDIA
hardware" — rather than to add an a/an helper, because a helper is interpolation logic and this pass
was not allowed to change any.

**Six more sites in the same shape are left open on purpose**, because each needs the sentence
restructured rather than a preposition moved, and the call is whether the helper is wanted after
all. Three of them are wrong on values reachable today: `A ${wait(chatTtft)} wait` in `verdict.ts`
(at 8, 11, 18 and 80–89 seconds), and `a ${params}B model` and `a ${k}/${v} cache` in `calibrate.ts`
(at 8.0B and 11.0B, and at `f16`). Three more are safe only because of what their guards happen to
admit, which is the reason to list them rather than the reason not to: `a ${kv} KV cache` in
`placement.ts` breaks only for FP16, which no catalogued runtime refuses; `a ${kv} cache` in
`launch.ts` renders under a guard that leaves only `q8_0` and `q4_0`; and `a ${ctx(agentSession)}
session` in `verdict.ts` is safe because every context ceiling in the catalog formats to a
consonant-initial string. A catalog row or a bar constant is all that stands between each of those
and the first group.

**The mechanical half found four defects, and the useful one is a markup leak.** `launch.ts`'s MLX
measurement note was written with `*length*` in it and printed the asterisks: `inlineProse` renders
`*emphasis*` for the Hardware picker's curated `detail` and for nothing else, so markdown written
into any other string is markup that never gets its transformation. That is the `inlineProse`
docblock's own lesson — reference prose emitted as UI copy without the transformation it needs —
pointed the other way, and it is the shape to check first the next time a note is added. The other
three: `Load this into the bench above` was the one straggler from #176's rule that the hero surface
is **the Bench** (the Matrix legend and the Envelope ring caption both had it right); the serving
verdict's spill clause ran two independent clauses together on a bare "so" where the clause fourteen
lines below it in the same `shortOfGood` list already carried the comma; and `family&rsquo;s` was an
HTML entity in a paragraph whose neighbour eighteen lines up writes the character.

**Two conventions were checked and deliberately not swept, and both are recorded here so the next
pass does not re-derive them.** _Apostrophes_ are split: the components and `stops.ts` use `’` in
plain string literals where nothing forced it, while `launch.ts`, `calibrate.ts` and `devices.json`
use `'`. Straight is numerically dominant (~57 to ~10) — but straight does not survive a
single-quoted string literal, so normalising that way flips three of them to double quotes and
churns the source style, and normalising the other way means rewriting sixty strings including
curated catalog prose. Neither arm is worth a copy pass; the inconsistency is cosmetic and invisible
at most sizes. _Serial commas_ have no dominant form to pick: seven user-facing three-item lists
omit the Oxford comma and five carry it, and README — the reference voice — carries it in both of
its. The honest answer is that there is no convention to enforce yet, not that one side won.

### Device pricing

Device prices are catalog provenance, not engine inputs. A numeric price is the **US launch list
price before tax** for the represented card or exact machine configuration. It is never a current
street price: the catalog records when the price was checked, cites price evidence separately from
the specification source, and labels a retained launch price as historical when the product is
discontinued. Every row has an explicit price state, so quote-only accelerators, products with no
public list price, unannounced hardware, discontinued machines, and CPU rows that represent only one
part of a configurable system never look like accidentally missing data.

The Hardware control and prerendered device metadata expose this state. Multiple cards are shown as
`N × price`, explicitly **cards only**, because the motherboard, host, power supply, chassis, and
networking are not priced here. Machine prices describe only the configuration named by the row.
Price-based ranking, dollars per token, current-market scraping, and complete-rig pricing remain out
of scope: making any of those trustworthy requires a separate, frequently refreshed catalog rather
than arithmetic over launch prices.

## v2 — guided mode, and what building it settled

Four features, filed under the
[`v2 — guided mode` milestone](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/milestone/1) and **all four shipped
on 1 August 2026**. The design for each lived in its issue while it was open; what is kept here is
what building it settled, because a closed issue is the one place nobody looks.

The common thread: the moat is correctness, and correctness is invisible to a first-time visitor —
every alternative _looks_ the same at a glance. Each of these either makes the accuracy legible or
removes the expertise the entry point assumed.

**The sequencing was part of the record, and it held — including the part that was a warning rather
than a plan.** Launch first, because its two prerequisites were real and are named below; calibrate
after it, because `llama-bench` is what calibrate pastes back. What did _not_ hold is merge order —
calibrate merged second of the four, since a review clears when it clears — and that was free
because **the dependency runs through the reader rather than through an import**: launch tells them
which command to run, and calibrate reads what it printed.

**That is a protocol, and it is much wider than it looks — which is the point worth carrying, since
one end of it is already a P1.** The emitter fixes the prompt length, the cache depth, the
generation shape, the layer count, the cache precision, the model and quant the command names, and
the output format, and `Calibrate` reconstructs those as its expectation.

**What it _validates_ is a strict subset of what it reconstructs, and the gap is not a bug.** The
depth and the prompt length are checked outright; the layer count, cache precision, model and
backend only when the paste states them; the decode length is deliberately not checked at all, since
a per-token rate does not depend on how many tokens were asked for; and the output format is not
part of the comparison, because both parse. Do not read the protocol as a set of guards —
`describeMismatch` is the guards, and it is narrower than the list above by design.

The danger is the part with no guard on either side. Nothing static ties the two modules together,
so a change to either is invisible to the other — which is exactly how
[#180](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/180) happened: the two ends disagreed about the
depth, which _is_ checked, so Headroom's own command emitted a row Headroom rejected. **Change the
emitter and re-read `compare` in the same sitting**, because there is still no compiler that will do
it for you. The depth now has the one guard the pair can have — `calibrate.test.ts` sweeps every
context stop, feeding `decodeBenchSpan`'s output through the real `compare` — and that is a test
rather than a type, so it holds only for the quantity it names.

The one thing they duplicate in code is the llama.cpp spelling of a cache precision. All five
branches were cut from `main` rather than stacked, so calibrate could not import it and copied it
under a comment saying the two must be merged when both land. **Both have landed and they are still
two copies** — recorded under **Calibrate** below. What follows is the
original sequencing note in its own tense, because every claim in it was load-bearing and three of
them were tested by contact.

Launch commands first — still the smallest lift, but not
the pure formatter the first draft of this section claimed, and the two prerequisites are worth
naming so #136 is not scoped off a false premise. `planPlacement` computes the layer assignment and
then discards it: its bins keep byte loads rather than layer counts, and only the busiest survives
onto `Placement` — so the split has to be surfaced before a formatter can read it, an engine change
that records what is already computed rather than new modelling. And a command may only name a
checkpoint that exists: the catalog carries the source repo id and no per-quant artifact, so a
runnable command for a non-native selection (Q4_K_M under llama.cpp, AWQ under vLLM) needs an
artifact resolver, or the feature is restricted to selections with a known artifact — which of
those is #136's first decision. A placeholder is honest only for the local file path, which is the
user's business either way; for the artifact itself it is a research assignment wearing a command's
clothes, and naming the source checkpoint instead would be the substituted-format failure (#18) in
copy-pasteable form. Calibrate still follows launch, and launching is necessary rather than
sufficient: a server up is not a measurement, so the command family has to include the benchmark
form — the scenario's prompt length, generation length and concurrency in the flags of the selected
runtime's own client — before a submitted number describes the priced workload rather than the
tool's defaults. One client per runtime, because `llama-bench` loads GGUF and cannot measure a vLLM
or MLX placement: each runtime's family carries its own, or calibration says out loud that it
starts at llama.cpp. That form is cheap once the assignment is surfaced, and it is the piece
calibrate actually pastes back.
Detect and recommend ship together as one guided-mode project, because
each is half of the three-click landing path — detect the machine, ask what the reader wants to do,
answer. Calibrate last: it is the slow-burn moat, and it compounds from the day the other three
make submitting easy.

### Launch commands, and what building them settled

**The artifact question resolved to the restrictive option, and the rule is smaller and better than
either arm the issue offered.** #136's first decision was an artifact resolver against "restrict to
selections with a known native artifact", and the answer turned out to be a one-line predicate: the
catalog can name **exactly one checkpoint per model — its own repo, at its own checkpoint format**.
`nativeQuant` is `quantization_config.quant_method` as the generator read it, and its absence means
the repo ships unquantized, which is the `bf16` row. So `artifactFor(model, quant)` is
`(model.nativeQuant ?? 'bf16') === quant.id ? model.id : undefined`, which covers all 35 rows rather
than the 9 the issue estimated — every model is nameable at exactly one format.

Everything else is a _conversion somebody else published_: a Q4_K_M GGUF, an AWQ pack, an
`mlx-community` port, in repos this catalog has never seen. A resolver for those is a new curation
surface with a freshness problem and no derivation behind it, which is the one thing this project
does not do. So vLLM and MLX refuse for a non-native selection and say what would have to exist.
**llama.cpp is unaffected and that is not a loophole**: `-m` takes a path on the reader's own disk,
which is the one case the roadmap already called an honest placeholder, so the GGUF family emits for
every selection while naming no checkpoint at all.

An unrecognised `quant_method` makes every format on that model unnameable rather than making the
wrong one nameable, which is the direction the whole module fails in.

**Four flags were not what a from-memory implementation would have written, and each was found by
reading upstream rather than recalling it.** This is the "a command is a claim, and flags drift"
trap paying out immediately rather than in six months:

- **llama.cpp's `-ngl` counts the output tensor.** `n_gpu_layers` defaults to `n_layer_all + 1` and
  `i_gpu_start = max(n_layer_all + 1 - ngl, 0)`, so a fully-resident 48-layer model wants `-ngl 49`
  — and what `-ngl 48` sheds is **layer 0**, not the output tensor. See the correction below; the
  first version of this bullet had that half backwards.
- **`-c` is the whole cache, divided among the slots.** `n_ctx_seq` is `n_ctx / n_seq_max` unless the
  KV buffer is unified, and passing `-np` explicitly is what turns unification off — so eight users
  at 64K is `-c 524288`. Passing the per-user figure gives each slot an eighth of it.
- **Ollama's Modelfile has no `num_gpu` parameter.** The documented list is `num_ctx`, `num_predict`
  and the sampler knobs. So the layer split this whole feature exists to print is the one thing that
  surface cannot be told, and the template says so rather than inventing a line. The issue's own
  sketch said "the `Modelfile`/`num_gpu`/`num_ctx` equivalents".
- **`mlx_lm.server` has no KV quantization flag.** `--kv-bits` is `mlx_lm.generate`'s. An
  8-bit-cache scenario therefore cannot be _served_ at the precision it was priced at, and the note
  says the served cache is fp16 and roughly twice the size shown.

**Three of those four were read correctly and the first one was half backwards, which only a second
source read caught** ([#202](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/202)). `-ngl` counting the
output tensor is right. "`-ngl 48` leaves the output tensor on the host" is not: the output tensor is
slot `n_layer_all` of `n_layer_all + 1`, and `i_gpu_start` shifts the resident window off the
**front** of the stack. Put `il = L` into the guard and `il - i_gpu_start = ngl - 1` is below
`act_gpu_layers = ngl` for every `ngl >= 1` — so the output tensor is on a GPU whenever anything is,
and `-ngl 48` on a 48-layer model sheds **layer 0**. Upstream states it in its own fitter: "the last
device has the output layer, which cannot be a partial layer". Read 5 August 2026 from
`src/llama-model.cpp:1318-1343` and `common/fit.cpp:581` at ggml-org/llama.cpp commit `360e134`, and
measured on an 18-layer Gemma 3 270M: at `-ngl 1` the only resident tensor is the output table, and
at `-ngl 18` layer 0 is on the CPU while the output is still on the GPU.

**The false sentence reached 56,612 commands, which is the part worth sitting with.** The `+1`
arithmetic is right where it applies — a fully-resident 48-layer model wants `-ngl 49` under either
reading — but `gpuLayers` applied it only on that branch, and emitted a bare `residentLayers` when
the placement spilled. The output takes a slot for any positive `-ngl`, so those commands loaded one
fewer repeating layer than the number read, and 1,530 of them were `-ngl 1`, which loads none. Every
emitted `-ts` was wrong for the same reason, on all 42,146 configurations that emit one: the ratios
summed to `L` while llama.cpp compares them against a key over `L + 1`, so the first card always
gained a layer.

**Both are fixed in [#204](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/204)**, ahead of #182's engine
change rather than after it: the packing rewrite moves which bin holds which layers, so it would
have invalidated the proof that this emission is exact. `-ngl` is now `min(residentLayers, L) + 1`
on every branch, and `-ts` states the output tensor's slot as a `+1` on one share so the ratios sum
to `-ngl`. An independent sweep of 361,200 configurations put the emitted pair through a port of
`llama-model.cpp:1285-1343` at `360e134`: 56,719 spilling commands wrong before and **0 after**,
42,037 `-ts` commands wrong before and **0 after**. `launch.test.ts` carries the port, so the guard
is the placement rather than the string — neither defect changed a string that looked wrong.

**Which share carries that `+1` took a second correction, and the sweep could not see the first one
be wrong** ([#209](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/209)). #204 put it on the last share
_with a layer on it_, which is the careful-looking choice and diverges from the engine exactly where
it matters: `planPlacement` charges `outputBytes` to the bin it **seeded**, always the last one, and
the seeded bin is the first to floor to zero resident layers — `spilledOf` clamps its overflow
against a `weightBytes` carrying the output block while `residentLayersOf` divides that overflow by a
`layerWeightBytes` that does not. So the flag put the table on a card the panel never sized for it
and left the card it did size idle: 1,801 placements diverge across the shipped catalog and 1,055 of
them emit a `-ts`, at offload fractions from 39.0% to 97.8%. The slot now goes to the **last share,
unconditionally** — its ratio is `c + 1 >= 1` whatever `c` is, so its cumulative boundary is the only
one clearing the final slot's key. #182's zero-layer suppression is not the guard against this and
cannot be: it runs before any ceiling is known and it guards _assigned_ layers.

**The sweep passed by construction, which is the lesson rather than the arithmetic.** "The output
tensor on the intended card every time" was checked by recomputing the emitter's own rule from the
same `sized` list the emitter reads — self-consistency, asserted as correctness, and 1,055 broken
commands went through it. The assertion now derives the expected card from `shares[].weightBytes`
against `weightBreakdown().outputBytes`: the bin the engine actually charged the table to. A test
whose expectation is spelled the way the code is spelled tests nothing, however wide the sweep.

**The even-split suppression is fixed too** ([#207](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/207)).
The original 89,615 figure predated #182's seeded packing and no longer described the population, so
it was re-measured on 16 August 2026 over the same 361,200 configurations: 235,819 reach a runnable
command, and **59,590** still reached the equal-resident-count gate — 34,621 fully resident and
24,969 spilling. The argument survives the smaller population unchanged: `L + 1` slots over `n`
cards cannot divide evenly when `n` divides `L`, so an even repeating-layer split cannot be left to
the default without moving a layer away from the card the engine sized.

The gate is gone. Every expressible multi-device window now emits `-ts`, and the existing last-share
rule gives the output slot to the bin whose byte accounting includes the output projection. Current
llama.cpp still derives an omitted split from **current free memory**, normalises it over
`min(ngl, L + 1)`, and selects with strict `upper_bound`; rechecked in
`src/llama-model.cpp:1317-1359` at commit `ad1de39e` (15 August 2026). A focused 8,8,8,8 test and the
catalog sweep both run the emitted flags through that upstream rule, compare delivered layers with
the engine assignment, and derive the expected output card from `weightBytes` and `outputBytes`
rather than restating the emitter's last-share rule.

The second is untouched. Where `residentLayers` floors to **zero** on a GPU rig the emission stays
`-ngl 0`: the `+1` rule would put the whole output table on a card that had no room for a layer,
which is nearer the priced placement on 96.3% of the 5,807 cases that reach it and **over the card's
own weight budget on 9.1%** — worst case a 2,004 MiB table into 344 MiB of room. The deciding
quantity is the table against the card's spare room, not how much spilled (r = 0.08 against
`offloadFraction`), so no threshold on the spill fraction separates them. The byte accounting that
would decide it has now landed with #182 — `Placement.deviceWeightBytes` and
`WeightBreakdown.outputBytes` state the two operands the question needs — so it is re-derivable
rather than blocked. Open, and open for a stated reason.

Where the false sentence also reached was a _justification_: `placement.ts` charges a
device's whole spill against its repeating layers, and called that the conservative of two readings
because llama.cpp supposedly shed the output tensor first. Under the real order it is not the
cautious reading, it is the only one llama.cpp can execute — the generous alternative, where the
fixed tensors leave and a spilling device still reports every layer resident, describes a placement
no `-ngl` expresses, since any `-ngl` holding all `L` repeating layers is at least `L + 1` and holds
the output too. Same count, sound reason instead of an inverted one. A backwards reason is worse than
an absent one for exactly the failure mode this file keeps warning about: the next person reasons
forward from it, and the tests cannot tell.

**The trap #136 names most sharply was reached from the far side, by the one flag the feature
exists for.** `-ngl` reads `assignment.residentLayers` and never a fraction, which was the trap the
issue named — and `-ts` was wrong, which nothing in its framing predicts because `-ts` is not a flag
it mentions. (Read once as "`-ngl` was right from the start". It was not: reading `residentLayers`
avoided the fraction and still emitted a count one short of what llama.cpp loads, on 27.6% of
emitted commands, until #204. Right about the trap, wrong about the flag.) It is the payoff of
surfacing the assignment: llama.cpp's
default split is
proportional to device _memory_, so on identical cards it is an equal number of layers, which is the
wrong split for a model whose layers cache different amounts.

The defect is that **`-ts` does not distribute the model — it distributes the `-ngl` window.**
llama.cpp puts the last `ngl` layers on GPUs and splits _those_ by these proportions, so the two
flags are read together, and the first version gave them counts from two different scopes: resident
for `-ngl`, assigned for `-ts`. llama.cpp then re-derives a per-device split that is neither.
gpt-oss-120b at Q8_0, 128K over 8 users on four 4090s packs 9,9,9,9 layers and keeps 3,3,4,4 of them
resident — so the emitted pair asked llama.cpp to spread fourteen layers _evenly_ over cards Headroom
had sized for three and four. That is an OOM on load, in copy-pasteable form, which is exactly what
the issue's `-ngl` trap warns about, one flag over.

Two things about how it was caught are worth keeping. **The "only when uneven" gate was wrong in the
same way and hid it**: reading assigned counts, it suppressed the flag entirely on that rig, so the
one case that mattered emitted nothing at all — equal counts of _unequal_ layers is precisely where
the split is needed. And **the test suite had a spilled case and a sharded case and never their
product**, which is where the defect lived; the issue's own verification note asks for "a spilled
one, a sharded one" and the conjunction is what was missing. Both are now one test, mutation-checked.

**Then the hybrid case turned out to have no flag at all, and that is a llama.cpp fact rather than a
Headroom limitation** (#166). `-ts` was narrowed in #164 to refuse any model with sliding layers,
because it proportions a _contiguous_ run of the `-ngl` window while `layerSplitBins` assigns
individual layers by greedy combined load. #166 filed the remaining capability gap and named
`-ot`/`--override-tensor` as the way to close it: it takes a pattern and a buffer type and can name
individual tensors, so a per-layer override list looks expressible in principle.

**It is not, and the reason is one level below the flag.** Three files say so, and none of them is
the argument parser:

- `llama_model::load_tensors` computes `dev_layer[il]` from `n_gpu_layers` and `tensor_split` alone
  — `i_gpu_start = max(n_layer_all + 1 - n_gpu_layers, 0)`, then an `upper_bound` over the
  normalised splits — **before** any override is consulted.
- The overrides are applied later, in `llama_model_loader::create_tensor`, by `std::regex_search`
  against a _tensor_ name. They change where a weight lives and nothing else.
- `llama_kv_cache`'s constructor takes each layer's cache buffer from
  `ggml_backend_dev_buffer_type(model.dev_layer(il))`.

So `-ot` moves a layer's weights to the card Headroom chose and leaves its **cache** on the card
`-ngl`/`-ts` chose — and on a hybrid model the cache is the entire reason the packing is uneven,
since the per-layer weights are uniform and a full-attention layer caches up to ~128x a sliding one
at 128K. The flag moves the half that does not vary. A command built from it would start a placement
other than the one the panel priced, which is refusal 1 rather than a caveat, so **`-ot` is not a
follow-up here — it is answered.** Read 2 August 2026 from `src/llama-model.cpp`,
`src/llama-model-loader.cpp` and `src/llama-kv-cache.cpp` at ggml-org/llama.cpp master.

What shipped instead is the engine half of #166 — `DeviceShare.layerIndices`, which says _which_
layers a card holds rather than only how many — and a panel that states the packing it cannot
express. Gemma 3 12B at Q4_K_M, 128K over 8 users on five 5090s reads `2,2,2,21,21` layers against a
composition of `2,2,2,1,1` full-attention ones: the 19-layer spread the issue was filed on, and the
second list is the fact the first one was hiding.

And it went on **both** llama.cpp launchers rather than the serving one, which is where the same
class was already half-covered: a `llama-bench` run at llama.cpp's default split times a placement
other than the one priced, and that is as true when Headroom cannot express its split as when it
declines to repeat an even one — so the number the calibration record collects was the one arriving
unqualified.

**Three things about it were wrong on review, and the corrections are the transferable part. Two are
the same mistake — a claim in prose that the code had never tested — and the third is this file's
oldest one, a class swept everywhere except the function directly above.**

**Being hybrid is a property of the model; caching unequal amounts is a property of the context**,
and #164's gate read the first. Below its shortest window every one of a hybrid model's layers holds
the whole context, so the packing hands out equal loads and a count describes it exactly — Gemma at
a 1,024-token context was refused a `-ts` that was available, and then told the flag was impossible
because its full-attention layers cache more than its sliding ones, which they do not at that
context. The gate is `layersCacheAlike(model, contextTokens)` now: cached _tokens_ rather than
bytes, since every other factor in `layerBytes` is model-wide, so it needs neither a precision nor a
runtime. That widens the flag rather than narrowing it, and the packing sentences share the
predicate — a scenario where `-ts` is exact is a scenario where they have nothing to explain.

And **the tail predicted a comparison Headroom has not made**. "Plan for the busiest card to hold more
than the panel shows" reads as arithmetic and is not: llama.cpp's contiguous split sometimes lands
the same composition the packing did — Gemma 3 12B on two 5090s at 128K packs `24,24` against `4,4`,
and so does an even contiguous halving — and finding out which would be this module deriving
llama.cpp's placement rather than formatting Headroom's. What is left is what Headroom knows: it packed for
a light busiest card and llama.cpp is not packing for that at all, so the figure is a floor to plan
against.

And the third was **a guard that already existed in the function directly above**. `tensorSplit`
returns nothing
when no layer is resident — `-ngl 0` already says it — and the packing sentences were written without
that check, so gpt-oss 120B at BF16 on two 4090s at 128K over 8 users emitted `-ngl 0` under two
sentences describing how llama.cpp would divide the cards' layers between them. That is this file's
N+1 rule arriving _inside_ a change made to sweep a class, which is the version of it worth
remembering: the sweep looked outward at the launchers and not upward at the function it was copying
a gate from. Both read `gpuLayers` now, so the note and the flag cannot disagree about whether
anything reached a GPU at all.

**And `llama-bench -d` answers #139's sharpest trap for free.** It runs the test at a stated context
depth, which is exactly the resident-prefix state `estimatePrefill` charges an agent turn against —
so the measurement form reproduces the priced workload rather than a standalone prompt. That was the
piece calibrate was said to need before it could ask anyone for numbers, and it exists.

**The flag exists; one invocation does not carry it to both tests** (found in review on #173, and
the paragraph above was written before it). `llama-bench -p N -n G` is not one benchmark — it is a
prompt-processing test _and_ a generation test, and **the generation test does not inherit the
prompt as cache depth.** So a single command measures decoding from an empty cache: the
weight-bound job, not the KV-bound one the panel priced, and at 128K the two are nowhere near each
other. The panel emits two invocations instead — `-p N -n 0 [-d prefix]` for prefill, and
`-p 0 -n 128 -d ctx-128` for decode — with the reason in a note beside them. Read forward into
calibrate, the single-command version would have submitted a decode rate measured at depth 0
against a prediction charged at full depth, and the comparison would have reported it as a
disagreement about the model.

**The two panels then disagreed about _which_ depth, and neither knew it**
([#180](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/180), a P1 from Codex on #175, fixed 5 August
2026). The emitter put `prompt + prefix` in the cache; `Calibrate` expects `contextTokens`, under a
docblock arguing that this is what `estimateDecode` charges every step's cache read at; and
`describeMismatch` rejects a depth off by more than 10%. So on the default 8K-prompt/32K-context
scenario **Headroom's own measure command produced a row Headroom marked unusable** — the likeliest
path a reader takes through this feature.

**It was filed as an engine question and settled as an emitter one, on a premise that turned out to
be wrong.** The issue reasoned that calibrate's expectation was unreachable, since `-d 32768 -n 512`
does not fit a 32K window — but `llama-bench` sizes `n_ctx` as `n_prompt + n_gen + n_depth` from the
test rather than inheriting the scenario's window, so the command runs; what it prices is a
33,280-token deployment rather than the 32,768 on screen. Take the generation out of the window
instead and the depth is reachable exactly. **`estimateDecode` was left alone, and charging the full
window is right on this app's own terms**: context here is "prompt plus everything generated so far",
a session filling across turns, and `RESPONSE_ALLOWANCE` is 512 — a 512-token answer in a 32K window
has a mean occupancy of 32,512, within 0.8% of what the engine charges. So the emitter moved:
`decodeBenchSpan` puts `-d` at `contextTokens - n` and asks for a short `-n`.

**`n` is llama-bench's own default of 128, held to a sixteenth of the window**, and the clamp is the
part worth remembering. The depth must land inside `describeMismatch`'s 10% at _every_ context stop,
not merely at the default: the fixed stops start at 2,048, but `coerce` clamps at 512 and a
hand-edited link lands there as a stop of its own, where a flat 128 would be a quarter of the window
and rejected. A sixteenth is exactly 128/2,048 — the smallest fixed stop — so the clamp never
binds at a stop, and a power of two cannot land on the threshold by float epsilon the way a tenth
can. `calibrate.test.ts` sweeps every stop against the unmodified comparison, for the emitted depth
and for the mean depth the run actually averages over (`contextTokens - n/2`), because the relation
is a ratio and not a constant the two files could share.

**The wall clock was the other half, and it is the half a reader would have felt first.** `-n` was
the window's whole remainder — 24,576 tokens on the default scenario, 11.5 minutes per repetition at
the predicted 35.6 tok/s, and llama-bench repeats five times: **58 minutes for one command**, against
about two and a half now. Decode is a steady-state per-token rate, so the long sample bought no
accuracy at all.

**And the corpus effect is starvation rather than bias, which is the version to remember.**
`submissionUrl` writes only the pairs `compare` did not reject, so the old command's shallow decode
row could not enter the record — it was thrown away with an explanation. What could enter was the
scenarios where `prompt + prefix` happens to land within a tenth of the window, which is to say the
ones with almost nothing left to generate. So the decode half of the calibration record — the half
that would eventually identify `bandwidthEfficiency` — was reachable through the panel's own path
only from a narrow slice of scenarios, selected on the very axis being calibrated.

**And the Ollama block stopped managing a daemon**
([#171](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/171), from Codex on #164), **which is one issue
answered in two directions at once.** It emitted `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=<type> ollama serve &` ahead
of the Modelfile whenever the scenario used a quantized cache — a line that neither waits for the
daemon nor notices an existing one. `ollama serve` fails to bind against a server already listening,
so on the machine most likely to be running Ollama it started nothing and everything after it ran
against a daemon still on the default `f16`. That is the placement the panel did not price. The issue
was filed rather than patched because fixing it honestly means a readiness poll, a running-daemon
check and possibly a `pkill`, in a block whose whole value is that it is one readable invocation
people run without reading.

**The two halves resolved opposite ways, and the split is the transferable part.** The cache
precision is _stated_: the line is gone, the block starts no server at all, and the note says to
start your own daemon with `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=<type>` — read once at startup, defaulting to
`f16`, not picked up by a daemon already running. Concurrency is _refused_: `planPlacement` charges
KV and activations for `usage.concurrency` users while the Modelfile carries only `num_ctx`, and
Ollama takes parallelism as `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` on the daemon — so every Modelfile this surface can
write sizes memory for one user against a panel that priced several. `llama-server` takes the same
quantity as `-np N` on the one command, which is where the refusal points.

**What decides between the two is whether the reader can act on the sentence.** "Restart your daemon
with this variable" is a complete instruction, and the emitted block is still true after it. "Your
Modelfile will be sized for one user" is a caveat printed beside a copy button for a command that
stays wrong however carefully it is read — which is the shape the MLX cache-precision refusal was
already settled against on #164. The polarity is not a judgement about how severe the gap is.

**The subshell and `set -e` stay, and that is not a leftover.** They were never about the daemon:
`set -e` is there because a heredoc cannot be `&&`-chained to what follows it, so a `set -C`
noclobber refusal would otherwise fall through to an `ollama create` against the reader's _old_
Modelfile, and the subshell is there so `set -e` does not survive into their interactive shell. Two
separate Codex findings on #164 and #173, at the same four lines. Deleting a line from the top of a
block does not retire the guards under it, and the tests now assert both on the quantized-cache
branch specifically, since that is the branch the removal touched.

One thing to watch that is not a bug yet: **`RuntimeSpec.preallocFraction` is 0.9 and vLLM's own
`gpu_memory_utilization` default has moved to 0.92.** The emitter states `--gpu-memory-utilization
0.9` rather than leaving it out, so the command reproduces what the panel priced — but the catalog
figure and upstream's default are no longer the same number, and whether the engine should follow is
a separate question from whether the command should state it.

### Detect, and what a browser will actually admit

**Three of the four signals are worth less than the issue assumed**, and each mapping was read from
a source rather than recalled:

- **`GPUAdapterInfo.architecture` does not identify a Mac.** Apple GPUs report no DeviceID through
  Metal, so Dawn reports the highest supported _common feature family_ instead — `common-1`,
  `common-2`, `common-3` — and every Apple silicon Mac from the M1 up reports one of those three,
  which do not partition the product line. So it identifies the **vendor and nothing past it**,
  which is worth more than it sounds: `detect()`
  prunes on it, and it is the one signal left when the vendor string itself is withheld. What it
  cannot do is say _which_ Mac, on the one platform where a unified-memory row is the headline case —
  `deviceMemory` and a follow-up question do that. ("Narrows nothing at all" is what this bullet said
  until #175, and `detect.ts`'s own docblock said it too.)
- **`navigator.deviceMemory` is capped at 8 in Chrome and absent in Safari**, so a reading _of_ 8
  rules out nothing at the top — and it does not mean "8 or more" either, which two drafts of this
  bullet claimed. Under the interval below, an uncapped 8 means `(6, 12]` and the clamp only removes
  the upper end, so the reading means **more than 6 GiB, unbounded above**: it is not a floor of 8,
  and a future lower-bound prune written from the old wording would exclude real 6–8 GiB machines.
  A reading _below_ 8 is a real ceiling and the detector uses it as one, pruning `unified-soc` rows
  only, since a discrete card's VRAM is unrelated to host RAM. **The rounding is to the _nearest_ power of two, ties going down** — the
  spec picks the lower bound when `mem − lower ≤ upper − mem` — so a reading of `r` means the
  machine has somewhere in `(0.75r, 1.5r]`, and `r` is not a floor: a 3.5 GiB machine reports 4. The
  shipped prune is `capacity <= 2r`, which is therefore **loose rather than tight, deliberately**:
  the only failure this module cannot accept is excluding the reader's own machine, and a bound
  wider than the interval never does. Two earlier versions of this bullet had it as "a floor, never
  a capacity" and then as rounded _down_ to `[r, 2r)`; both were caught on #175, and the second is
  the dangerous one, because tightening `2r` on that reasoning would start excluding real machines.
- **The adapter limits narrow nothing, and that is the second review's correction rather than the
  first draft's claim.** `maxBufferSize` looks like a sound floor — the largest single buffer a
  driver will hand out, capped well under total memory, so a device below it is impossible. It is a
  _validation_ ceiling on a buffer descriptor instead: WebGPU checks a request against it and can
  still fail with an out-of-memory error, so a limit above a device's real capacity is not a
  contradiction, and pruning on it removed the reader's actual machine. It ships as evidence the
  reader can weigh, and prunes nobody. **This paragraph said the opposite until Codex caught it on
  #175** — the handoff document quietly re-proposing a prune the feature had already withdrawn is
  the specific way a file like this does damage.

**The architecture table is transcribed from Dawn's own data file _through its generator's rule_**,
which is what makes it right and is not the same claim as the model catalog's. `gpu_info.json`
stores `RDNA 3` and `Gen 12 LP`, and `dawn_gpu_info_generator.py`'s `js_enum_case()` lowercases and
joins with a hyphen _except after a digit_, where it joins with nothing: `rdna-3` but `gen-12lp`,
not `gen-12-lp`. Reading the names without the transform gets every Intel row wrong, and a web
search returned both `rdna-3` and `rdna4` for the same field.

**There is no script, and the roadmap called it "generated" until Codex asked where the generator
was** (#175). `models.generated.json` has `scripts/build-catalog.ts` and is regenerable by anyone;
this is thirty-odd literal entries in `detect.ts` with the source URL and a read date in the
docblock. Refreshing it means re-reading `gpu_info.json`, applying `js_enum_case()` by hand, and
moving the date — which is a procedure worth stating rather than a rule worth invoking, because
"derived, never typed" promises reproducibility this table does not have.

**The rule that keeps the panel honest is one line — a filter that would leave nothing is a filter
that is wrong about this machine.** Every prune is applied only if something survives it, and one
that would empty the list is recorded as a conflict the surface states instead. That is the issue's
"fall back when the signals conflict" made general, and it has a reachable case rather than a
theoretical one: an **Intel Mac** reports an Intel or AMD adapter on a macOS platform, and the
platform prune took the vendor's rows to zero — the first version rendered "Which of these is
yours?" over an empty list. An iPhone with WebGPU does the same from the other side. `candidates`
is never empty, which is what the heading is allowed to assume.

**Nothing is applied on the reader's behalf, and the pressed state has to be the panel's own.**
Reading `deviceId` for it marked a candidate confirmed before anyone pressed anything, because on
the default page the configured device is in its own detected set — the panel opened with an answer
already given, which is the silent-selection failure the whole feature is organised against,
arriving through the affordance built to prevent it.

**Two accessibility details cost a round each, and both are the same shape: a mechanism that
displaces what it was added to.** `role="status"` _replaces_ the implicit role, so it took the
results panel out of the `region` landmark it is named by — the panel stopped being addressable as
"Which of these is yours?" at the moment it became announceable. `aria-live="polite"` adds the
behaviour and leaves the role alone. And the heading has to follow the branch: over a terminal
state, "Which of these is yours?" is a live region announcing a question above a paragraph
explaining there is nothing to answer.

**One finding was answered rather than fixed.** On a dual-GPU laptop `requestAdapter` returns one
adapter and the vendor prune then removes the other GPU's rows, and the review asked for both
preferences to be queried and combined. Preferring the discrete card is not half of that — for a
tool that prices inference it is the answer, and combining them would _widen_ the shortlist to two
vendors, which is the opposite of what the panel does. Filed as [#174](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/174),
as the argument rather than as a bug.

### Recommend, and the printed rule that was false on 347 configurations

**The sweep's axes are the engine's, not the Matrix's.** The Matrix renders every cell under one
globally selected runtime, KV precision and substitution at a hardcoded `deviceCount: 1` — its
cells are a _slice_ of the space rather than the space. So this sweeps models × runtimes ×
applicable quants and takes KV precision, device count and concurrency as explicit inputs.
Concurrency being explicit is not tidiness: hardcoding 1 let the shortlist and the verdict strip
grade the same configuration's batch row differently on one page, so clicking a row landed the
reader on a grade contradicting the one that sent them there.

**Every ordering is exported as a sentence and rendered beside the list** — `RANKING_RULE`,
`FALLBACK_RULE`, `QUANT_RULE` — because a ranked list with an unstated basis is an opinion wearing
the chassis of a measurement, which is the failure this codebase is organised against. Two of those
sentences are load-bearing in a way worth restating. The within-tier order is **parameter count,
which is a capability _proxy_ and says so**: Headroom knows what runs, not what is good, and importing
benchmark scores would be a new curation surface with a freshness problem. And the fallback is a
different question with its own rule — when nothing clears the bar, "the biggest that loads" is the
wrong answer, because a 671B at 0.3 tok/s is not more useful than an 8B at 40 that merely missed a
threshold.

**Then the quant rule was false on 347 shipping configurations, and the cause is a docblock this
repo had already written.** `QUANTS` is grouped by checkpoint family and runs widest-first _inside_
a family, so it is deliberately not globally bpw-descending — `q8_0` at 8.5 sits below `nvfp4` at
4.5, as `quants.ts` states at length. `bestQuant` walked the caller's list and stopped at the first
`good`, so it met `mxfp4` (4.25) before `q6_k` (6.57) and picked a narrower format than the printed
sentence promised. The first draft documented "widest first" as the caller's responsibility and the
only caller passed `QUANTS.filter(...)`. **A precondition a caller can silently violate is not a
precondition**: the sort is imposed inside `recommend()` now, because the policy depends on the
order and therefore owns it.

The sentence was wrong a second and independent way. It read "the widest format that clears the
bar", and `bestQuant` prefers a narrower `good` over a wider `tight` — tiers rank above width
everywhere else in the module. "Clears the bar" was doing two jobs in one file, and the wording now
says what the comparator implements.

**The test that caught it was wrong four times first, and that is the transferable part.** It was
unfalsifiable; then its comparison was backwards; then `<=` still passed, because a divergence where
the widest format grades _equally_ is not a violation; then it swept a single device. Four
corrections before it failed against the reinjected defect — on a defect whose entire signature is
"an ordering assumption that is silently true on most rows". Mutation-check anything asserting an
ordering, and sweep more than one device while doing it.

**One entry per model in the runners-up**, which is a rule rather than a tidy-up: the runtime axis
means a strong model appears two or three times over — gpt-oss 120B at Q5_K_M under llama.cpp _and_
at NVFP4 under vLLM — and a shortlist whose three rows are two spellings of one model has not
offered a choice.

**What was filed rather than patched is one root with three symptoms**, and it is the sharpest thing
this feature turned up: **the sweep plans one placement per candidate, and the verdict layer models
a tier structure.** Long-context's `tight` tier is graded at a 64K prompt against its 128K job, and
the agent's tiers carry 64K and 32K sessions against a ~16.5K turn — so a candidate can be dropped
before the tier that would have graded it ever runs, a spill caveat can describe the `good` tier's
scenario on a row that only earned `tight`, and the fallback can rank by a decode rate no tier ever
measured. [#170](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/170) and
[#172](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/172); fixing them means changing how the two layers
divide the work, which is why neither is a patch.

**#170 is fixed, and it is the layers dividing the work differently rather than a repair.**
`gradedScenarios` is `verdict.ts` stating its tier structure as an interface, and `planGraded` is the
sweep walking it largest-first for a scenario this machine can plan. One scenario decides everything
about the candidate — the grade, the figures and the spill caveat — and the candidate carries it, so
the deep link that loads the row into the Bench lands on the configuration the row was graded at
rather than rebuilding the archetype's request.

**#172 is fixed too, and two of its three findings were already closed when it was opened** — by
#170's own fix, which is what "one root with three symptoms" turns out to buy when the root is
actually moved. What was left was the one finding on the axis `gradedScenarios` does not express:
serving's tiers differ in _users_ rather than in working size, so `declaredConcurrency` states those
and the shortlist carries them. See **Open questions** for the verification, the measurement, and
the one thing this deliberately did not change.

### Calibrate, and what a measurement has to carry

`compare` marks a long list of scenario mismatches rather than reporting a delta against them, and
`describeMismatch` is where that list lives — deliberately not restated here or in the module
docblock, since four rounds of #175 went on a paraphrase of that one function that diverged from it
differently each time. The property worth carrying is narrower than it first reads: **the checks on
the paste's own optional metadata fire only when the paste states the field**, so a row naming
neither the model nor the cache type compares clean, and unstated is not rejected except where a
default makes silence itself a claim. The guards that read the _prediction_ — a configuration the
engine refuses, a runtime `llama-bench` cannot measure, a concurrency it cannot reproduce — fire
whatever the paste contains, since no field in it could answer them.

**The placement check compares llama.cpp slots, not two layer counts**
([#208](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/208)). A prediction of `N` resident repeating
layers accepts `-ngl N+1`, because every positive llama.cpp value spends one slot on the output
tensor; a prediction of zero accepts only `-ngl 0`. Fully resident runs accept any value at or above
`L+1`, since llama.cpp clamps those values to the same placement. Bare `-ngl N` is not a legacy
spelling of the partial placement and bare `-ngl L` is not a spelling of full residency: each leaves
one repeating layer on the host that Headroom did not price. The panel emitted the former spelling
between #169 and #204, but calibration now rejects those old runs rather than admitting a known
different placement into the fitting corpus. Rejection copy names the pasted slot value, the
repeating layers it actually loads, and the value Headroom emitted so those three quantities cannot
read as a contradiction.

What is worth recording here is the handful of causes **invisible in the numbers**, since those are
the ones a reader gets wrong without noticing.

**Two of those are rejected**: a different prompt length and a different depth. A `pp512` paste
against a prediction made at 16,384 tokens is not a disagreement about the model, it is two different
jobs, and reporting the gap as evidence is how a calibration record fills with noise.

**Two are recorded rather than rejected, and saying otherwise is a claim about a check that does not
exist.** The **build** is one: `describeMismatch` never examines `buildCommit`, because there is
no expected build to compare against — the catalog pins a runtime, not a commit of one — so a paste
from a six-month-old llama.cpp is comparable and submittable, with the commit riding into the issue
body for a human to weigh and its absence stated rather than assumed benign. The **machine** is the
other, since `llama-bench` does not name the host reliably, which is why the scenario URL is a
required field in the template. #139 calls the first of those a version-skew guard; it guards a
reviewer's judgement, not this module's arithmetic. Two rounds on #175 went on that distinction —
first the claim that `compare` rejected build skew, then this sentence still counting it among the
ways a measurement becomes _unusable_ while the paragraph under it explained that it does not.

**The model is checked twice, and the parameter count is the half that carries the hard case.**
llama.cpp writes an architecture where the catalog writes a product, so the two never agree past the
first word — which is exactly how far the name check goes, matching on the leading token. That
catches a DeepSeek paste against a Llama prediction, including the markdown rows where no parameter
column was printed, and it misses Qwen3 8B against Qwen3 32B entirely. The count is what separates
sizes inside a family: the same quantity on both sides, derived rather than named, flagged past 10%
because the two counters differ slightly and a wrong model is wrong by a factor. Neither subsumes
the other, and this paragraph said the count replaced the name until Codex caught it on #175.

**A `-pg` row is dropped rather than read as prefill**, and the first version read it on a comment
that was simply wrong. `llama-bench` computes a row's rate as `(n_prompt + n_gen) / time`, so a
combined row is a _blend_ dominated by the slow half: 7,000 t/s of prefill and 100 t/s of decode
come out around 473. Beside `prefillTokensPerSec` that is a 93% miss with nothing marking it, and
submittable as calibration evidence. There is no way to recover either rate from one number.

**Parsing a markdown table needs a per-column decision about shape versus position, and all three
answers differ in one table.** The rate cell was first taken as the first numeric cell, which read
`ngl` — 33 — as a throughput of 33 tok/s on a row measuring 7,285: every column between `model` and
`t/s` is a number on some backend, so "shaped like a number" does not identify that column. The
spread does when it is present, and `t/s` is last when it is not. `params` (`8.03 B`) and the backend
word are found by shape for the same reason in reverse — each is distinctive, and a position would
break on the next column upstream adds.

**`ngl` was then found by _position_, and the position was already broken**
([#181](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/181), fixed 5 August 2026). A bare integer is not
a distinctive shape, which is a true observation and an argument for reading the header rather than
for counting from `test`: llama-bench prints a column for every setting that is not at its default,
in its own field order, **between `backend` and `test`** — so the middle of the table is exactly the
part a position cannot describe. `type_k`/`type_v` land there on any non-default cache, which is what
the panel's own command asks for; `ts` lands there on the multi-GPU command; and on a CPU backend
`ngl` is not printed at all while `threads` is. The consequences ran in both directions. A displaced
`ngl` is _lost_, so `describeMismatch` skips the placement check and an offloaded run compares clean
against a fully-resident prediction — a wrong number entering the record rather than an unverifiable
one. A CPU paste was worse: the cell before `test` was the thread count, so a 96-thread EPYC run was
marked as 96 layers on a GPU it does not have, which is a _false_ rejection of exactly the
measurements the second calibration anchor is made of.

**So the header row is read once and the columns with no distinctive shape are indexed by name.**
That is one fix for both halves of #181 — a cache-only fix would have closed the quieter half and
left the louder one — and it is why the parser now tolerates a reordered table, an unknown column,
and a llama-bench too old to print either pair. Three rules make it safe rather than merely
indexed: a row whose cell count does not match the header's is read as though it had no header,
since a header that does not describe a row cannot name its cells; a missing header falls back to
the positional read rather than failing, because a reader pasting one row out of a table is not a
parse error; and empty cells are kept rather than dropped, because the header is now what says which
column a cell is and a blank one would shift everything after it.

**Unverifiable is not the same as matching**, and treating it as such let a paste with no stated
cache precision sail past a Q8 or Q4 prediction. It is called out as unverifiable now, with the
`-o json` re-run named — but **the limitation was the parser rather than the format, and saying
otherwise is how it survived two reviews**. `parseMarkdown` had no branch for `type_k`/`type_v` at
all, so no markdown paste ever carried a cache precision, including the one the panel's own
`-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -o md` produces with the columns printed: the reader who followed the panel
exactly was told their correct run looked like f16. Reading those columns was the other half of
#181, and what reaches the unverifiable branch now is a run that really did leave the cache at its
default — the one case llama-bench prints no columns for. Both halves of the pair or neither, since
`-ctk q8_0` alone prints one column and completing it with the default would invent the field the
mixed-cache check exists to compare.

**The band is judged on the rounded percent**, per the rule this file already carries for thresholds:
a raw comparison put a 30.0% delta outside the ±30% band on float epsilon alone
(`0.30000000000000004 <= 0.3`), and a figure that prints as "within 30%" beside a verdict of "wider
than 30%" is the panel disagreeing with itself.

**The paste never leaves the page.** Submission is a `github.com/…/issues/new` URL the reader chooses
to open, which is the same no-backend shape the weekly catalog refresh already proved out.

**Two loose ends, both bought by building these in parallel branches, and both live on `main`
today.**

The first is a duplicated constant. `Calibrate.tsx` carries `LLAMA_KV_TYPES` — `fp16 → f16`,
`q8 → q8_0`, `q4 → q4_0` — under a comment saying it is "duplicated rather than imported only
because that module is not on this branch, and the two must be merged when both land". Both have
landed. It is three entries and it is the mapping that decides whether a paste is judged against the
cache precision it was measured at, so the two copies disagreeing is a silent wrong verdict rather
than a build error.

The second is not a bug yet and spans the same two files: **the emitted `llama-bench` command asks
for `-o md` while the parser prefers JSON.** The block is meant to be read before it is run, so
markdown is a defensible choice — but JSON is what carries `build_commit`, which #139 names as the
version-skew guard, so a reader who follows the panel exactly arrives without it and is told to
re-run. Which
way that resolves is a product decision; what is not defensible is the two files disagreeing about
which one the panel emits, and `parseJson`'s docblock claimed the other answer until this was
written down. It costs less than it did: since #181 the commit is the only field the JSON re-run
buys, where it used to be the cache precision and the layer count as well.

Deliberately absent, and not forgotten: cloud pricing stays out of scope per the settled decision
below, and fine-tuning memory (LoRA/QLoRA) is a second engine rather than a feature — real demand,
weak incumbents, and deliberately not attempted before guided mode shipped. Now that it has, that is
the v3-scale bet. **Nothing filed stands between here and it.** The six issues in
**Open questions** are all resolved as of 3 August 2026 — five fixed, and
[#174](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/174) closed as a _record_ of an answered policy
question rather than as work. The two that came out of reviewing this very document are resolved
too, both on 5 August 2026: #180, the P1 on the path a reader is most likely to take, and #181, the
parser that could not read the output that path produces. #182 — the half of #165 its own
verification note said not to fold in, and a different provenance from the other two — is fixed the
same day, on the source reading its blocker named. Counting #174 as a blocker would have made a
settled decision look like a task, which is why no count here ever did.

## Deployment

Two workflows, and the interesting decisions are in what each refuses to do.

**`catalog-refresh.yml`** regenerates the catalog every Monday and opens a pull request rather
than pushing to `main` — a model whose KV heads changed overnight is exactly the case a human
should see, and it is indistinguishable, to the job, from Hugging Face returning plausible
nonsense. Four things about it are easy to get wrong and are already wrong once elsewhere:

- **`git diff --quiet` is the wrong question.** `build-catalog.ts` stamps `generatedAt` on every
  write, so the file differs after every run whether or not a figure moved. Wired to that, the job
  would open an empty pull request every week for the rest of the project's life — and people who
  stop reading a bot that is right one week in fifty also stop reading it the week it matters.
  `scripts/catalog-diff.ts` compares `models` and `failures` only, and is unit-tested in both
  directions.
- **No `--allow-partial` on a schedule.** The generator refuses a partial write by design; a
  scheduled job is exactly where a 503 on five of seventeen seeds would silently delete 29% of the
  product. A red run is the intended outcome of a bad fetch.
- **The whole gate runs inside the refresh job, before the PR is opened.** Verification is a
  publication precondition, not delegated to the PR: a new model with an attention shape the engine
  cannot price must never reach the refresh branch. Publication uses a short-lived installation
  token from the repo-only `headroom-catalog-publisher` App because GitHub suppresses workflow
  events caused by `GITHUB_TOKEN`; App-authored PR creation and refresh pushes therefore trigger the
  ordinary CI workflows. The workflow's own token remains read-only, while the
  installation token explicitly narrows the App's Contents and Pull requests grants to read/write
  for this repository and is revoked when the job ends.

  **Claude review was removed on 2026-08-18** and no longer runs on these pull requests. It handed a
  long-lived OAuth token to a job whose definition the reviewed pull request controlled, and each
  containment attempt was bypassed in turn; see `MrZoller/opencode-factory#48`. The publisher-bot
  allowlist described below went with the workflow, so if review is ever restored that allowlist
  must be restored with it. Codex is the review gate in the meantime.
- **Whether to commit on top of `catalog/refresh` or reset it is decided by whether a pull request
  is open on it** (#193). Committing on top preserves review already left on an open PR, which is
  the one thing the job exists to invite. With no open PR there is no review to preserve and the
  branch is nothing but the last run that failed to publish, so building on it carries an
  ever-older base forward. One `gh pr list --head … --base main --state open` answers both that and
  the create-versus-edit question at the end; asking twice would let a PR merged mid-run make the
  two halves disagree silently. Backed by a guard that runs before the push: the branch's diff
  against `main` must be exactly `models.generated.json` or the job fails and pushes nothing,
  which is why the checkout is `fetch-depth: 0` — the diff is asked from the merge base, and a
  shallow clone has none.

The publication path was verified live in both directions in August 2026. Manual
[run 31913354836](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/31913354836) rebuilt the stale
branch from the then-current `main` and opened [PR #219](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/219);
scheduled [run 32005181371](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32005181371) then
committed a later substantive refresh onto that open branch and updated the same pull request. The
repository's default workflow token remains read-only while Actions is allowed to create pull
requests. The resulting [three-dot comparison](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/compare/main...catalog/refresh)
changes only `src/data/models.generated.json`; the branch may fall behind `main` while its pull
request is open, because preserving its review history is deliberate and the merge-base diff is the
non-destructive change GitHub would apply.

The review-trigger path uses repository variable `CATALOG_APP_CLIENT_ID` and Actions secret
`CATALOG_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`; neither credential is committed. Manual [run
32089353541](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32089353541) minted the scoped token,
pushed substantive head `c09d549`, and updated the then-open PR #219; GitHub immediately emitted
the PR `synchronize` [Claude run
32089491994](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32089491994). After closing that PR,
[run 32089548826](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32089548826) reset the stale branch
from current `main` and opened replacement [PR #232](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/232)
as `headroom-catalog-publisher[bot]`; GitHub emitted its `opened` [Claude run
32089732330](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32089732330). Both emitted reviews failed
at Claude Code Action's separate bot-origin guard because the allowlist was not yet on `main`, so
`claude-code-review.yml` explicitly allowlists this App slug rather than permitting every bot. A
temporary App-authored [PR #233](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/233) against the task branch
then reached the allowlisted workflow, but [run
32090820299](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32090820299) declined to review because
Claude Code Action requires that workflow to have identical content on the repository default
branch.

*Historical record, retained deliberately.* The workflow those runs describe was removed on
2026-08-18 for a credential-exposure hole unrelated to the bot-origin work above, so none of these
runs can recur. The default-branch-identity requirement in the last sentence is worth keeping in
view: it turned out to be the only guard the action applies to itself, and it is not a substitute
for the workflow definition being trusted.

The allowlist landed separately in [PR #234](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/234), after
which both paths completed end to end against the default-branch review workflow. To make the update
test substantive rather than timestamp-only, controlled head `52fc12e` made one catalog download
count stale on the open PR; refresh [run
32093117907](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32093117907) restored the generated
value with App-authored head `4223caf`, emitted a `synchronize` event, and Claude [run
32093254279](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32093254279) accepted the allowlisted bot
and delivered its review on [PR #232](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/232). After that
evidence PR was closed and its branch deleted, refresh [run
32093559305](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32093559305) rebuilt from current `main`
and opened [PR #235](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/pull/235) as the publisher App; its
`opened` event likewise ran Claude successfully in [run
32093670938](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/actions/runs/32093670938). Thus creation and later
refresh pushes both enter the ordinary review path without widening the existing untrusted-PR
guards.

**Read this before re-deriving #193's damage estimate.** `git diff main catalog/refresh` on the
stranded branch read as thousands of deletions, and #193's status comment took that as the diff a
merge would apply — which is why only `models.generated.json` was cherry-picked out of the branch
rather than the branch being merged. It would not have applied them: GitHub renders and merges a
pull request from the **merge base**, and the branch's three-dot diff was one file — the catalog —
the whole time. It was cut before later changes, not on top of a revert of them. The staleness was
real and worth fixing; the deletions were an artefact of the two-dot diff, and the number growing
every time `main` moved is what made a safe branch look unmergeable.

**`deploy.yml`** publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`, and does. The first
deploy ran on 28 July 2026.

Getting there needed a decision rather than code. Pages on a private repo requires a paid plan —
`POST /repos/MrZoller/bench/pages` returned `422 Your current plan does not support GitHub Pages
for this repository`, which is a hard block and not a settings toggle. The repo went public
instead, which also lifted the ruleset limitation recorded below. The workflow itself needed no
change.

Its preflight job stays, and is still worth having: it checks whether Pages exists and skips the
deploy with a notice rather than failing red. A fork with no Pages gets a green run and an
explanation instead of a broken-looking one.

Three settings are repository variables rather than committed values, because they describe where
the site is served rather than what it is, and all three fail _quietly_ when wrong:

| Variable              | Default | What it is for                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PAGES_BASE_PATH`     | `/`     | Vite's `base`. A Pages _project_ site serves from `/<repo>/`; a custom domain serves from `/`                |
| `PAGES_SITE_ORIGIN`   | unset   | The origin prerendered pages write into `<link rel="canonical">`, `og:url`, `sitemap.xml` and the share link |
| `PAGES_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` | unset   | Written to `dist/CNAME` each deploy, since Pages drops the domain otherwise                                  |

`PAGES_SITE_ORIGIN` arrived with prerendering (#178) and is the same class of setting as the base
path, which is why it is a variable and not a constant: a built page states its own canonical URL,
and that claim needs an origin that no amount of reading the code can supply. Inferring
`<owner>.github.io` would be right until a custom domain is attached and then wrong without saying
so — the failure this pair exists to make visible. **Unset is a supported value.** A fork, a local
build and CI's own `build` job all run without it: the canonical link is then written root-relative,
which is valid and resolves against the page's own address, and `og:url` is omitted rather than
invented. Setting it is what turns both absolute, and it is also what decides whether a
`sitemap.xml` is written at all: `<loc>` has to be a complete URL, so a build with no known origin
writes no sitemap rather than an invalid one. It moves together with `PAGES_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` and
`PAGES_BASE_PATH` — a custom domain means all three change at once.

`PAGES_BASE_PATH` holds the repo's own name, because a Pages _project_ site serves from it.
Attaching a custom domain means setting `PAGES_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` **and** returning `PAGES_BASE_PATH`
to `/` — changing one without the other is the failure mode this pair exists to make visible, since
a wrong `base` produces a blank page with 404s in the console rather than a build error. Verified
after the first deploy: the served HTML referenced `/bench/assets/…` and both assets returned 200.

**The rename to Headroom made that variable load-bearing a second way** (#176). The base is not in
`vite.config.ts` — it is `process.env.BASE_PATH || '/'`, fed from this variable by `deploy.yml`, and
`/` is the default because `npm run dev`, `npm run preview` and the Playwright suite all assume it.
So renaming the project could not change the base by editing code, and the code change is
deliberately not the thing that moves the site. The order that works is: merge the rename, rename the
repository to `MrZoller/headroom`, then set `PAGES_BASE_PATH` to `/headroom/`. Between the second
step and the third the site is built for `/bench/` and served from `/headroom/`, which is the blank
page with 404s described above — the window is one settings change wide, and it is the reason the
repo rename is not part of the pull request that renames everything else.

## Decisions already made

Settled, with reasons. Reopen only with new information.

- **Hero surface is the Bench** — direct manipulation: pick a model and hardware, drag usage
  sliders, watch a stacked memory budget fill and overflow. Envelope and Matrix are secondary.
- **Build-time data, not runtime.** Keeps the site static and offline-safe; freshness comes from
  a scheduled regeneration job, not a fetch on page load.
- **Visual identity** is a dark instrument-panel chassis — a sibling to `~/code/wavefront`, not a
  clone. Different accent hue. Tokens in `src/design/tokens.ts`, mirrored as CSS custom properties.
- **Multi-GPU is modelled as a homogeneous rig** (`{device, count}`) with tensor-parallel
  sharding and an interconnect penalty. Heterogeneous mixes are out of scope.
- **Pricing is out of scope for v1.** Cloud $/Mtok versus local amortised cost is a different
  tool wearing the same chassis.
- **A PR merges on green CI, with outstanding review findings triaged, replied to, and filed as
  issues — not fixed first.** Set on 25 July 2026, after 74 resolved findings and no end in sight;
  the stack finished on 97. Every push drew a fresh review, including on the fixes from minutes
  earlier, so under "merge only when the reviewer comes back clean" there is no reachable fixed
  point. This is not a decision to ignore reviews: fix root causes, then merge, then file the rest.
  See #9–#20 for what that produced in practice. **This overrides the global "a PR is unfinished
  until the latest review is clean" rule, for this repo.**
- **Expect a review to name a subset of a class.** Three times now the finding named N instances
  and the same defect was live in N+2 places — a missing-cause audit raised for three verdict tiers
  was also true of chat and rag; an Envelope fix had a mirror-image omission one branch over; and
  the long-context "grade the job you admit" fix was separately true of serving, agent and rag
  (#9–#11), filed as three unrelated bugs and in fact one. Fixing only what is named is the most
  common way a round here fails to converge.
- **The seven archetypes are not a ladder, and completion may outrank chat.** The ordering is real
  but it is _only_ about latency budgets, and it does not survive contact with capacity. Completion
  sends 512 tokens where chat sends 1,024, so at 128 users on a small card the chat cache spills
  while completion's stays resident — serving 128 autocompletes genuinely is easier than 128
  conversations. Capping
  completion at chat's grade would restore the appearance of a ladder by reporting a failure that
  is not happening. The claim was dropped instead; the thresholds stay independent.
- **A qualifier attaches to a claim, not to a subject** ([#160](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/160)).
  The narrow Matrix readout shows a tapped spilled cell as "spills 66% to host RAM" and carries no
  host-RAM caveat, and it stays that way. `HOST_RAM_UNCHECKED` exists because `planPlacement` sizes a
  spill with no host-RAM input at all, so any surface saying a spilled configuration **loads** is
  promising something the engine never checked — and the test is the verb, not the topic. The wide
  form promises ("runs only by spilling…") and carries the constant; the narrow form states the spill
  and promises nothing. Both channels that do promise are width-independent — the `title` and every
  cell's `aria-label` are the same `full` string at 320px as at 1440 — and the colour is not a third
  promise either, since `measureValue` scores a spilled fit at 0 under `fit`, the dimmest step.

  Granting it was costed rather than argued: at 200% text on a 320px viewport the rem floor doubles
  while the line width halves, so the full sentence needs a 10rem reservation and even the
  inline-clause register needs 7.5rem — **120px of permanently reserved blank space on a phone
  against 80px today**, on every page view whether or not the grid holds a spilled cell. And the
  brief register does not survive the move: "if the host has room for **them**" points at the
  _weights_ the Envelope's count line names one clause earlier, and this sentence names none, so
  granting the caveat properly would need a third spelling of one fact — the drift the two-register
  pair exists to prevent.

  **The finding's true half is recorded rather than repaired**: the legend line carrying the
  panel-level caveat is non-sticky, so it is off screen at exactly the moment the sticky readout
  exists for. The answer to that is the caption and the legend at panel level plus the two per-cell
  channels above — not a reservation levied on every narrow reader for a claim the narrow line is
  not making. Reopen only with a shorter register that reads correctly beside "spills 66% to host
  RAM", since the reservation is what the wording costs.

## Things that took real work to get right

Each of these was wrong first, and each is silent when it breaks. Do not "simplify" them without
reading the test that guards them.

**Engine**

- **Active weight bytes must use the dense/expert split**, not the model's blended bits-per-weight.
  gpt-oss active params are ~half BF16 dense tensors read in full every step; charging them the
  4.47 bpw blended rate understates bytes-per-token ~2×, straight onto decode throughput.
- **`bandwidthEfficiency` and `CLASS_BANDWIDTH_UTILIZATION` are two knobs fitted to two data
  points, and only their product is observable.** The split between "what the runtime achieves"
  and "what the memory subsystem allows" is _not identifiable_ from current data — it is a
  defensible physical story, not a measurement. It becomes testable when a second CPU-capable
  runtime or CPU device is added. Re-derive then; don't assume.
- **Compute precision comes from the quant's `computeDtype` gated on the runtime's
  `nativeLowPrecision`**, never from storage bit width. llama.cpp dequantizes every GGUF to fp16,
  so it cannot reach a Blackwell card's FP4 rate. Inferring from `bpw` overstated prefill 8×.
- **KV shards only as far as the model allows, and `placement` and `speed` must agree on how
  far.** Weights divide to any degree; GQA divides by attention head, so 4 KV heads on 8 cards
  replicate across each pair and per-card KV is a quarter, not an eighth. MLA has no head axis at
  all — vLLM keeps the whole latent on every rank. `kvShards()` is the one answer and both modules
  call it; when only `placement` knew, the memory panel said each card held the entire DeepSeek
  cache while the speed panel priced one eighth of it.
- **A layer split is not a speedup, and a layer count is not a KV divisor.** llama.cpp's default
  multi-device layout runs whole layers in sequence for one token, so a single stream sees one
  card's bandwidth and one card's FLOPS however many cards there are — that rig buys capacity,
  not speed, and modelling it as aggregate credited eight cards with ~4.9x. And on a hybrid model
  the layers are not interchangeable: Gemma's full-attention layers cache ~128x what its sliding
  ones do at 128K, so the busiest card is found by _sizing_ an assignment, not by dividing.
- **The spill fraction is the rig's, not the busiest device's.** `layerSplitBusiest` returned one
  device's load, so `offloadFraction` was a per-device ratio — and both speed estimators multiply it
  by the _whole model's_ active weights. Under a layer split the cards hold different amounts, so
  the cards that are still resident were billed host-bus time for an overflow at the cards that are
  not. Gemma 3 12B at 128K over five cards puts two of its eight full-attention layers on each of
  three cards and one on each of the other two, and almost no weights on the heavy three — so the
  busiest card holds 4% of the model: a 0.25 GiB overflow read as 87% of every weight streaming,
  against a true 11%. Every bin's load is kept now and the bytes that actually spill are summed. The
  uniform case — tensor parallelism, one device — is unchanged by construction, since `n` identical
  overflows over `n` identical shards give back the same ratio.

  `impossible` moved with it, and dragged a sentence along: it now asks _every_ device whether cache
  and activations alone are over, because the busiest card by _combined_ load is not necessarily the
  one holding the most cache. That broke an implication two panels were relying on — it used to be
  true by construction that an impossible offloadable rig had the busiest device's cache over the
  ceiling, so BudgetBar rebuilt the figure from `kvBytesPerDevice`. On Gemma 3 12B over three 4090s
  it then read "the cache and overhead alone need 19.1 GiB" under a header reading 23.0 GiB, and
  disproved the refusal beside it. The refusing floor is carried on `Placement` as
  `floorBytesPerDevice` instead, so the predicate and its sentence read one value. (#14.)

- **A cached prefix is a declaration, not a default.** `estimatePrefill` took its linear _and_ its
  attention work from `promptTokens`, so it could only express a standalone request — a prompt
  attending over itself. Every multi-turn archetype describes something else: `n` new tokens
  attending against a `P`-token prefix already resident. `attentionPairs` now takes the prefix and
  charges `n * P + causal(n)` on a full-attention layer, with sliding layers capping the prefix at
  their window on the same dispatch they already make.

  Two things about it are easy to get backwards. **It makes prefill slower, not faster** — a prefix
  cache saves _re-reading_ the prefix, which this function never charged for, and it does not make
  the new tokens cheaper to attend. And **it is opt-in per archetype** (`Workload.prefixIsCached`,
  declared on the agent alone) rather than derived from `contextTokens - promptTokens`: deriving it
  would have moved every archetype at once, including the single-prompt scenarios the calibration
  anchors are measured at. The prefix-0 path is bit-identical to the expression it replaced, and a
  test asserts that as an identity rather than inside the ±30% band, which would have absorbed the
  mistake silently.

  **The prefix is the session minus what the turn needs**, and every sentence has to say so. It took
  two review rounds to state it correctly. `agentSession` is the whole window, so the first draft
  printed the window itself — claiming a cache holding 80K of working set in a 64K window. The
  second subtracted the turn but not its answer, spending the entire budget on prefix and prompt and
  leaving the 512-token reply nowhere; the tell was at the boundary, where `cachedPrefix(needs(id))`
  returned 512 and claimed the room to answer as cached history for a scenario with no history at
  all. It goes through `needs(id)` now, which is the same boundary `fits` tests, because a limit
  stated twice is a limit that will disagree with itself — a comment this file already carried about
  a different copy of the same number.

  The consequence is a real regrade: 8B at Q4_K_M on one 5090 goes from 6.0s to 14s on an agent turn
  against the 47.5K resident in a 64K session — about seven times the query-key pairs — which is the
  difference between clearing the 10s bar and not. The threshold did not move; the estimate started
  describing what an agent does.

  **The capacity bars were not part of it**, and the review's second claim — that a rig holding
  exactly 64K is admitted for a request needing another 512 — does not hold. The session constants
  are windows, not prompts, so they already include generation; the agent's prompt-level bar
  (`fits`, at 16,896) does carry the allowance; and once the prefix is 47.5K the occupancy closes on
  65,536 exactly. Long-context is the deliberate contrast: its bars _do_ add the allowance, because
  its 131,072 is a `typicalPromptTokens` and needs room to answer on top. Same numeral, different
  kind of quantity — and widening the session bars would have forced `holdsFullSession` to advertise
  a "64.5K session".

  **Chat is the honest second candidate and is deliberately not declared.** It is back-and-forth by
  its own description and re-reads nothing under the same caching. Deferred rather than dismissed:
  at an 8K context a 1K turn against 7K resident is ~15x the pairs against a 2s bar, so it regrades
  chat on slow rigs and wants its own evidence. (#23.)

- **Offloaded weights read at the slower of host RAM and the bus to the host** —
  `min(hostBandwidth, device.hostLinkBytesPerSec)`. `interconnect` is the _device-to-device_ link
  `tpEfficiency` models and is not this: an H100 SXM talks to its neighbours over NVLink and to
  the host over PCIe 5.0. Modelling only host RAM made every spilled configuration on a PCIe 4.0
  card 2.5× too fast, on both decode and TTFT.
- **Prefill scales with concurrency; decode amortises it.** `estimateDecode` batched from the
  start and `estimatePrefill` ignored `usage.concurrency` entirely, so a 32-user configuration was
  graded on one user's time-to-first-token. The asymmetry is the whole point and is easy to get
  backwards: decode is memory-bound, so the weights are read once per step however many users are
  waiting and the tenth is nearly free. Prefill is compute-bound and one long prompt already
  saturates the units — serving `n` prompts is `n` times the arithmetic and the scheduler only
  chooses who waits for it. Two consequences worth stating: attention is evaluated at one
  sequence's length and _then_ scaled (sixteen users sending 2K each is sixteen quadratics over 2K,
  not one over 32K), and the offload streaming term is charged **once** — sized at the batch-wide
  expert union, but not multiplied by it, because the batch shares the weights it pulls across the
  bus. `prefillTokensPerSec` is machine-wide as a result, which is what keeps the published
  single-prompt anchors comparable with a concurrent estimate. Every sentence quoting it therefore
  has to say whose rate it is: the RAG verdict divides the batch back out, because the wait printed
  beside it is one document's; Telemetry and batch label theirs as aggregate instead. (#11.)
- **A rule the UI enforces is not a rule the engine has.** `quantApplies` kept unloadable
  model/runtime pairings out of the picker, so the app looked correct while `planPlacement`
  returned capacity and throughput for checkpoints that cannot be opened — AWQ under llama.cpp, a
  GGUF K-quant under vLLM. Every caller reaching the engine directly (Matrix, Envelope, anything
  importing `evaluate`) walked past it. The same gap produced the Matrix's P1: its quant
  substitution asked `quantApplies` without the runtime _and_ fell back to a hardcoded Q4_K_M, so
  under vLLM every dense row that fell back was scored at a format vLLM cannot read. Validate at
  the boundary.
- **Sharding needs a link, and refusing a rig means refusing its arithmetic too.** `canShard` keys
  on `interconnect`, not device class — a DGX Spark is `unified-soc` with a real ConnectX, a Mac
  Studio is the same class with nothing between chassis. Every divisor and multiplier that read
  `rig.count` now goes through `effectiveDeviceCount`, because the first attempt at this set the
  `unsupported` message and left the split running: eight Mac Studios were still reported as
  holding an eighth of the model each, and `achievedBandwidth` still summed eight cards over an
  interconnect that does not exist. A refusal that returns arithmetic for the impossible
  configuration is not a refusal.
- **Prefill attention is causal and respects sliding windows.** These are decoder-only models, so
  a full-attention layer computes `N * (N + 1) / 2` query-key pairs, not `N^2` — charging the
  square nearly doubles the attention term at long prompts and moves the point where the tile
  claims attention dominates. Sliding layers are causal too: a triangle while the window fills,
  then a band. The two corrections compound to about 3.7x on gpt-oss at a 16K prompt.

  Correcting this moved the DGX Spark prefill anchor from ~10% over to ~19% over. Per the rule
  below, the constants were **not** retuned to pull it back — a roofline that matches an anchor
  because it was fitted to it has stopped being evidence of anything.

- The two calibration anchors are **DGX Spark on gpt-oss-20b** (2,053 tok/s prefill, 49.7 tok/s
  decode) and **EPYC 9654 on DeepSeek-671B Q8** (~6 tok/s). They pin opposite ends of the roofline;
  a model calibrated only for discrete GPUs fails one of them.
- **Do not retune the constants to re-centre an anchor after fixing a bug.** Correcting the
  per-token basis moved Spark decode from ~10% under to ~19% over and Spark prefill from ~6% under
  to ~10% over, while EPYC stayed within 1% — proof the old fit was partly absorbing those errors.
  The knobs were left alone deliberately. Re-centring right after removing what a fudge factor was
  masking is how the next error gets hidden. All three sit inside the ±30% band the tests assert.

**Prerendering** (#178, Phases 2 and 3)

- **Zustand's server snapshot is `getInitialState()`, and it is a closure over the state the store
  was built from.** The plan for #178 proposed `useConfig.getState().replace(config)` as the seam
  for injecting a route's scenario and verified it by printing `getState()` — which does change.
  The markup does not: `useStore` passes `api.getInitialState` to `useSyncExternalStore` as the
  third argument, React calls exactly that one on the server, and it returns the object built at
  import time, which on a build machine is always `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. Three device pages came out
  within 45 bytes of each other and every one of them was a DGX Spark. **Page size is the check
  that cannot see this**, which is why the Phase 2 slice is three devices in three classes and the
  verification is a diff of the figures. `src/entry-server.tsx` updates the state object both
  halves share; assigning `useConfig.getInitialState` instead does nothing, silently, because
  `create()` returns `Object.assign(hook, api)` and the hook only carries a copy.
- **A prerendered page rewrites its own URL unless the "bare or complete" rule gets a baseline.**
  `configToSearch` returned `''` only for `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, so on `/rtx-5090/` — where the device
  differs from the default by construction — it returned all nine fields and `useUrlSync` replaced
  the pretty path with a query within 400 ms of hydrating. The baseline is an argument now, and it
  is the route's own scenario. The rule itself did not move: a query that is present is still
  complete, and a bare one still claims nothing beyond the address it sits on.
- **The client half of a prerendered route is `readInitialConfig`, and it cannot move to an
  effect.** The store is a module-level singleton whose initial state is evaluated at import time,
  so a first paint of the wrong scenario is the same whole-tree mismatch one tick later. It reads
  the path and the query together, query winning.
- **`404.html` is the shell, never a prerendered page**, or every unknown URL on the site claims to
  be an RTX 5090. And `main.tsx` branches on an explicit `data-prerendered` marker rather than on
  `hasChildNodes()`, because the shell's whitespace is a child node and hydrating an empty
  container is itself a mismatch.
- **A model id is not a path segment, and the bare basename is one upload away from a collision.**
  All 35 ids are `org/name`, so 35/35 change under an `encodeURIComponent` round-trip. The slug is
  `org--name` lowercased, derived in `catalog.ts` and never baked into `models.generated.json` —
  the basename alone is unique today, and the catalog already carries `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`,
  a mirror, so the day the seed list gains the original the two pages share a filename and the loser
  is simply gone. Devices keep the top level and models sit under `/m/`, because otherwise the two
  namespaces overlap with nothing enforcing separation; `catalog.test.ts` asserts no device id is
  `m` and none equals a model slug.
- **The pair tier is per class, or it is twelve NVIDIA cards.** `devices.json` is grouped by class
  in display order, so a flat first-twelve is one vendor answering one question at twelve price
  points. 6 discrete GPUs / 4 unified-memory / 2 CPU, each the leading rows of its class, and ten
  models from `modelsByPopularity()` so the shortlist tracks Hugging Face instead of rotting — 13
  of 35 rows changed rank across one week's refresh.
- **A sitemap with relative URLs is not a lesser sitemap, it is an invalid file.** `<loc>` must be
  a complete URL, so with `PAGES_SITE_ORIGIN` unset the build writes **no** `sitemap.xml` rather
  than one a crawler reports as a parse error — the same call `pageHtml` makes when it omits
  `og:url` instead of inventing an origin.
- **The build refuses to write a page with no figures in it.** `missingFigures` checks every page
  against four rendered patterns before a byte is written, because the way #178 comes back is a
  file of the right name and roughly the right shape with nothing computed inside it. The verdict
  _word_ is deliberately not one of the four: `Fits|Tight|Will not run` matches every page in the
  catalog because those words are also legend entries, while none of them alone is universal
  (`Fits` 126 pages, `Tight` 182, `Will not run` 186) — an alternation satisfied by chrome is not a
  check. Two of the four accept "there is no speed to report", which is what the 19 pages whose
  model overflows the machine correctly say instead of a rate.

**Tests**

- **`e2e/` covers what jsdom structurally cannot, and nothing else.** Layout, scrolling,
  `@media (pointer: coarse)`, and canvas actually painting — everything else stays in Vitest, where
  it runs in a second. The rule is not tidiness: the gap shipped a bug. The Matrix's click-to-scroll
  was anchored on a `display: contents` element, which generates no principal box, so
  `scrollIntoView` returned early in every real browser — and jsdom has no `scrollIntoView` at all,
  so the guarded call passed every test. Caught in review; the replacement was believed correct and
  had never been observed working. All three scroll specs now fail if the anchor is put back.
- **A spec that measures the wrong element is worse than no spec**, and this suite produced three
  of them on the first run: a region-wide button locator that caught the measure toggles instead of
  the grid cells, `getByLabel('Model')` matching the Matrix's own section name, and
  `getByRole('button', { selected })`, which Playwright rejects outright. Each looked like an app
  bug for a few minutes. Mutation-check anything asserting geometry.
- **The touch project is emulation, so it asserts the emulation first.**
  `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches` is checked in its own test before any size is measured,
  or a change in how Playwright emulates a device silently moves every other assertion onto the
  mouse branch, where they all pass.
- **`vite preview` binds `localhost`, which is `::1` on an IPv6 host** — so the config passes
  `--host 127.0.0.1` to match the URL Playwright probes. Without it the run dies on a `webServer`
  timeout that says nothing about why.
- **Pin the state a conditional defect needs, and assert you reached it before measuring.** The
  Matrix legend's overflow (#34) needed three keys at once, two of them conditional, and on a fresh
  page only one renders — so a spec written against `/` passes with the bug intact. The scenario is
  in the querystring (`?r=mlx&q=q5_k_m`) and the three keys are asserted in their own test. Deleting
  the query params leaves all four geometry assertions green and fails only that one, which is what
  it is for.
- **Measure the viewport the defect actually needs.** The same spec was first written at 390px,
  where there is no overflow at all: the prose keys wrap their own text and the panel's padding
  absorbs the rest. It appears at 360 and escapes to the document at 320. Four assertions passed
  against unfixed markup before the widths were probed rather than assumed.
- **And the fix that closes the filed issue is rarely the whole defect.** The ramp is `flex-1`, so
  its flex basis is 0 and it is the only item in the row that yields. On the filed markup that put
  it at **zero width at every viewport from 320 to 1024px** — the legend's entire subject missing
  on a laptop, while the prose about the exceptions sat at full size, and nothing reported it.
  `flex-wrap` alone does not fix that: a zero-basis item still takes only the free space left on
  its own line, so it survives wherever a line breaks early (139.8px at 390, 373.8 at 640) and
  collapses wherever the keys nearly fill one (69.8px at 320, **13.6px at 1024**). A floor on the
  ramp group is the other half — `min-width` is resolved into the hypothetical main size, which is
  what both line-breaking and shrinking are measured against, so the ramp claims a width or takes a
  line of its own. The two halves are separately mutation-checked, and the desktop layout is
  unchanged by either.
- **A `rem` floor is a floor the viewport cannot argue with.** The obvious `min-w-48` fixes the
  ramp and quietly reopens the overflow: browser text scaling grows the root font size without
  shrinking the viewport, so at 320px with a 24px root the 12rem floor alone took the document to
  343/320 — the sideways scroll the wrap was added to remove, returning in the one setting a reader
  most needs it gone. `min-w-[min(12rem,100%)]` yields instead, and is identical at the default
  root. Worth checking on any `min-w-`/`w-` in rem that a narrow layout depends on.
- **Reflow at 200% text is a different test from reflow at 320px, and the page passed one while
  failing the other by 89px.** WCAG 1.4.10 asks about a narrow viewport at the default text size,
  which this app already satisfied; 1.4.4 asks about text scaled to 200%, which browsers do by
  growing the root font size and leaving the viewport alone. So every rem-derived width and every
  `whitespace-nowrap` line grows and nothing gives them more room. Fixed in #35, and the shape of
  the fix is the point: the filed instance was one of four identical `whitespace-nowrap` panel
  headers, now one `PanelCount` that protects the numeral pair — "12 of 425" broken across a line
  reads as two unrelated numbers — and lets the noun after it wrap like the prose it is.

  **The second offender was not a nowrap at all, and would not have been found by fixing the first
  one.** A non-wrapping flex row's min-content is the _sum_ of its children, and the segmented KV
  control sets the width of its grid column — so four options at a 32px root widened three `w-full`
  sliders in a panel the control is not part of, and it was the _sliders_ that left the viewport.
  `flex-wrap` makes the floor the widest single option instead. Two separate mechanisms, one
  symptom; the probe that proved the first fix is what found the second, which is the general
  lesson worth keeping.

  **The third offender was padding, and only CI could see it.** Both fixes above passed locally
  with 18px to spare and failed on the Linux runner by 4px, on markup neither run had changed. The
  cause is that the app's font stack — `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', …` —
  resolves to SF on a Mac and to fontconfig's default sans on a runner, which is wider. **The
  overflow was real, not an artefact**: the page genuinely scrolled sideways for anyone whose
  system sans is wider than SF, which is most Linux users and any Windows machine not reaching
  Segoe UI. Measuring on one machine's typography is measuring the machine.

  The lever was padding, because at a 32px root the shell consumed **146 of 320px — 46% of the
  viewport** before any content was laid out. `p-4`/`p-5` are rem-derived, so they grow with the
  text while the viewport does not. Every one is now `p-[min(1rem,4vw)]` / `p-[min(1.25rem,5vw)]`,
  which is identical at the default root and yields only when the root font has outgrown the
  screen — the same shape as the `min-w-[min(12rem,100%)]` fix in #34, and the general form of that
  lesson: **a rem length in a layout a narrow viewport depends on wants a viewport term beside it.**

  `e2e/reflow.spec.ts` now runs every scenario twice, once at the host's own fonts and once at
  `'Courier New', monospace` — deliberately wider than any UI sans, and present or metric-aliased
  on all three platforms. That is what makes the verdict portable rather than a description of the
  machine that ran it, and reverting the padding fix now fails on a Mac. Two details that cost a
  round each: Verdana is **not** wide enough to reproduce the CI failure locally, so a spec written
  at Verdana would have shipped the same green-here-red-there result again; and the font has to be
  set through `--font-sans`, because `body` sets `font-family: var(--font-sans)` and an inline
  `style.fontFamily` on `<html>` loses to it silently. The spec asserts the stress font really is
  wider than the host's before trusting any of it.

  It holds at 200% only. Past a 40px root the page is **not** clean — long single words like
  "Unsupported" and the slider labels start escaping — and that is recorded rather than fixed,
  because 1.4.4 stops at 200% and "the bar is met" is a different claim from "the layout is
  unbreakable".

- **Absolute pixel type does not scale, and the precondition meant to catch it only checked a
  heading.** Both Envelope axes were `text-[10px]`, so at 200% every other figure doubled while
  they stayed put — a 1.4.4 failure outright, and worse than the numbers suggest, since the labels
  became _relatively_ half the size on the surface a low-vision reader had just asked to enlarge.
  They are `text-[0.625rem]` now, identical at the default root. Two neighbours went with them, and
  all three are one shape — **a length derived from a glyph width, written in pixels**: the
  Envelope's `MIN_COLUMN_PX` (the column those labels sit inside) and the Matrix's `headerHeight`
  (a character count times a pixel constant, sizing a `text-xs` label whose rotation clips when the
  row is short — since #64 it is `headerBand`, and both of its lengths are `rem`). The general form
  is the thing to keep: a length measured from text belongs in the same units as the text. (#42, #44.)

- **A rotation costs two lengths, and `headerHeight` only ever charged for one** ([#64](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/64)).
  `sin(45)` and `cos(45)` are the same number, so the Matrix's device labels leaned as far sideways
  as they stood tall — 246px of reserved band at every viewport, and 142px of the same quantity
  leaking out of a scroll container the grid otherwise fitted _exactly_ at both 1440 and 1024. The
  grid got a scrollbar it did not need, the default view hid the last four device names, and the one
  it cut off first was the 40-character label the 246px had been calculated from. Both numbers now
  come from one expression, which is the actual repair; the rest is what the repair had to get right.

  **The obvious label fix reintroduces the bug the rotation exists to prevent.** The filed
  suggestion is to strip the parenthetical — `(12-ch DDR5-4800)`, `(512 GB)` — since it is already
  in the tooltip and every cell's `aria-label`. Unconditionally, that collapses the three Mac Studio
  M3 Ultra rows into one string three columns wide, which is precisely the "a header that cannot
  distinguish its own columns is worse than none" failure the 45-degree labels were introduced to
  fix. The qualifier is dropped only where the rest of the name is already unique across the
  _rendered set_, so a catalog addition that collides with an existing stem lengthens both labels
  instead of quietly making one ambiguous. 40 characters becomes 25, and the band 161px.

  **No trailing lane works, and two were built before one did.** The filed suggestion is to reserve
  `cos(45) × longest` to the right of the grid. As `padding-right` it is non-negotiable, so at 1024 —
  min-content 857px inside a 934px panel — a 141px lane forces 65px of scrolling onto a grid that
  fits. As a yielding grid track, `minmax(min-content, 1fr) minmax(0, lean)`, it takes only the free
  space that happens to exist, which is not a quantity anyone controls: at 960px of viewport the
  container is 870px, the grid 857px — it fits — and `scrollWidth` was 920px anyway, with
  "Threadripper PRO 7995WX" painted 50px outside the visible right edge. That version shipped to
  review with both of its own geometry assertions sitting above the 948–1009px window it broke. The
  lesson is the one this file keeps writing down in other words: **a reservation whose size is "the
  space left over" has not reserved anything.**

  **Leaning the labels the other way has no width dependence at all** — the issue's third lever, and
  the one that holds. Anchored `right-1/2` and turned `+45deg` about `origin-bottom-right`, each label
  ends at its own column and runs up-and-_left_ over the model-name column, which is in flow and
  inside the scroll container at every width. `scrollWidth == clientWidth` at 1440, 1280, 1060 and
  1024, and `scrollWidth == the grid's own width` at 960, 390 and 320; the grid also gets back the
  141px the lane was taking off its width at 1440. Text that ascends left-to-right has to lean right,
  so this is geometry rather than taste: the direction and the anchor are one choice.

  **What that buys has to be reserved, because overflow to the left is worse than overflow to the
  right.** Right-side overflow is at least reachable by panning; left-side overflow is not scrollable
  at all — the name is gone at every scroll position. So the model column carries an explicit
  `min-width` of the same `lean` the band is derived from: 8px of real effect today (the longest model
  name asks 133px, the lean 141px), inert at 1440 where auto table layout hands the column 338px, and
  binding at 390 and under 200% text. `matrix-header.spec.ts` asserts the contract — the reservation
  covers the furthest any label actually leans — at the two widths where it binds, since at 1440 the
  slack would make it pass without testing anything.

  **And the sweep is the interesting half.** The defect class is not "a rotated label" — it is _any_
  scroll container whose scrollable area is enlarged by something out of flow: a rotation, an
  absolute label, a ring, a shadow. All three of the app's `overflow-x-auto` containers can do it,
  so `matrix-header.spec.ts` now checks every one of them: a container may only scroll as far as its
  **in-flow** content reaches. That sweep was wrong twice, in ways worth keeping. First it measured
  each child's `scrollWidth`, which counts the rotated labels because they are descendants of the
  table — green against the filed defect with 142px of overflow in front of it. Then it compared
  in-flow content against `clientWidth` instead of against `scrollWidth`, which is trivially true of
  everything that scrolls at all: green again, at 390px, against the same defect. Both versions read
  as coverage. The rule has to name the two quantities it is actually about, and out-of-flow boxes
  have to be excluded by hand.

- **The Envelope's axis titles are stacked rather than rotated, and the cost of rotating is smaller
  than it first looks — a fraction of a column, not a column.** Both axes were bare number strips:
  the gutter ran 1…128, the strip under the plot ran 2K…128K, and the only thing separating "128
  users" from "128K tokens" was a `K` in the smallest and faintest type on the page — while the
  hidden table, the caption and the canvas `aria-label` all named both quantities. The picture was
  the one representation that did not say, and its y axis runs bottom-up, which was stated only in a
  source comment, so a reader assuming top-to-bottom read the default field as "128 users at 2K is
  the comfortable cell" when it is 1 user at 2K.

  Width on this surface is genuinely scarce — `MIN_COLUMN_REM` floors every column and the plot
  already scrolls inside its own box at 320px, where it measures 364px of content in a 230px
  viewport — but **the first version of this note priced a rotated title at that whole ~110px
  label and that is wrong.** `writing-mode: vertical-rl` costs one line box of horizontal space, and
  costs the plot's _content_ width nothing at all; only its scroll viewport narrows. (`rotate-90` is
  the expensive one: transforms do not affect layout, so the element still reserves its unrotated
  box. That is the implementation the ~110px figure described, and not the one anyone would reach
  for.) Recorded because a later session reading the old wording as a hard constraint would decline a
  rotated title on the Matrix — whose axes are still untitled — on a number that is wrong for the CSS
  it would actually write. **The real reason to stack is legibility**: 12px type on its side is the
  least readable ink on a surface whose entire complaint was that its meaning rode on the least
  readable ink, and the ↑ has to read as up. Vertical space is the axis this panel has spare.

  The x title sits _outside_ the scroller so it stays centred on what the reader can see rather than
  on the scrolled content. Both titles are `aria-hidden`, like the tick strips, because the canvas
  `aria-label` is the textual equivalent and a visible title in the accessible tree has a screen
  reader hear each axis named twice. `e2e/envelope-axes.spec.ts` holds the geometry at 320px — the
  title above the canvas, the plot's width accounted for by the tick gutter and the row gap alone —
  and it is red with the titles deleted, checked. Its three box comparisons measure a **`Range` over
  the glyphs, not the paragraph**: both titles are block children of full-width containers, so their
  element rects are their containers' rects for any alignment and for text that overflows, and the
  centring and in-panel assertions were all true with `text-center` deleted before that substitution.
  Same lesson as the `getClientRects().length === 1` note below. (#81.)

- **One name per setting, and `SETTING_LABELS` is where it lives.** The same #81 fix found the Usage
  sliders saying "Context per sequence" and "Concurrent users" while the Envelope's table caption
  said "context length" and its row-header column said "Users" — two settings under three spellings,
  in one panel, with the field's own axes naming neither. Same failure `kvLabel` exists to prevent,
  one level up, and the same shape the "expect a subset of a class" rule predicts: the issue named
  the two missing titles, and more hand-written copies were live. The constant is keyed by `Config`
  field and `satisfies Record<keyof Config, string>`, so the keying is a claim the compiler checks
  rather than a comment — including the four setup labels, whose second reader is the Matrix's
  `sr-only` "Model" row axis, agreeing with the control today by coincidence.

  **The line is whether a surface names a setting or says something in a sentence**, and prose stays
  prose. "Currently at 32K context and 1 user" is a sentence about a cell; so is the Envelope's
  subhead, "How much room is left — context against concurrent users", which is also the section's
  `aria-labelledby` target. Substituting the labels there was tried and reverted: it renders "How
  much room is left Context per sequence against Concurrent users", announced verbatim every time
  the landmark is, which is worse English than the drift it prevents and out of register with the
  Matrix's sibling subhead. Axis titles, captions and column headers name settings; headings and
  hints talk. (#81.)

- **Simulating text zoom by setting the root font size is not text zoom, and a test built on it
  reports layouts nobody can reach.** Widening the reflow sweep to the `sm` and `lg` boundaries —
  640 and 1024 — produced six red tests and three plausible-looking layout bugs, all artifacts.
  Tailwind v4's breakpoints are `rem`, and **`rem` inside a media query resolves against the
  browser's _initial_ root font size, not an author-set one** — measured, not assumed: with
  `documentElement.style.fontSize` at 32px, `(min-width: 40rem)` still matches at 640px. So the
  simulation grows the text and leaves every breakpoint where it was, and the page lands in states
  real zoom never produces: three columns crushed into 213px each at a width that, for an actual
  reader at 200%, is a single stacked column.

  **The fix was to stop simulating.** `--blink-settings=defaultFontSize=32` changes the browser
  default — the thing a reader actually changes — so the breakpoints move with the text: `sm`
  becomes 1280px and `lg` 2048px, both verified. The `reflow` Playwright project launches with it
  and the spec asserts both that the root is 32px and that 640px is now _below_ `sm`, so a
  Blink-internal switch silently ceasing to work fails loudly instead of quietly re-testing at
  100%. The sweep then covers 320/640/1280/1920 honestly.

  Worth recording that the first attempt concluded the opposite. `--default-font-size` — a
  plausible flag name that does not exist — was tried, had no effect, and became a written claim
  that faithful emulation was impossible, with a carefully-reasoned model built around the
  limitation. The model was correct and the reason for it was false. A negative result about a
  tool is worth one more minute of checking than a positive one, because nothing later contradicts
  it. (#41.)

- **A grid of buttons is one tab stop, not four hundred** ([#52](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/52)).
  The Matrix is 408 cells, each a `<button>` with a full-sentence `aria-label`, and it sits _above_
  the Usage panel in DOM order — so reaching the context slider that drives every figure on the page
  took 422 presses of Tab, and a screen-reader user heard 408 sentences on the way. The ARIA grid
  pattern is what that is for: `role="grid"`, a roving `tabIndex` so exactly one cell is in the tab
  sequence, arrows to move between cells, Home/End and Ctrl+Home/End for the ends. 422 becomes 15.

  **Why this one survived when the other four axes did not**: touch targets, reflow at 200%,
  coarse-pointer queries and palette contrast all have tokens and specs behind them, and focus order
  had nothing looking at it. An axis with no spec is not an axis anyone is checking.

  A skip link was the cheaper alternative and is deliberately absent: past the roving index it saves
  a single keypress, and it never addressed the screen-reader traversal at all — which was the
  larger half of the problem.

  **The counting splits across both suites, deliberately.** The tab _sequence_ is a DOM property —
  `tabindex="-1"` is reachable by script and never by Tab — so `App.test.tsx` asserts it in a
  second. Whether pressing Tab actually lands where the sequence says is something jsdom cannot
  answer at all: it implements no sequential focus navigation, so a Tab keydown moves nothing and
  `document.activeElement` stays put. That half is `e2e/matrix-grid.spec.ts`. Both were checked
  against a reinjected defect, and the two that fail in the browser are exactly the two jsdom
  cannot see.

  Left alone at the time: **the Usage controls stayed below the two grids in DOM order.** They are the
  primary input and there was a real argument for moving them, but that read as a layout decision
  about what the page leads with rather than a keyboard-reachability bug, and the fix above already
  took the walk from 422 presses to 15.

  **That deferral was resolved the other way in #66, and the reason is worth recording because it is
  not the one this paragraph anticipated.** The argument that carried it was not distance and not
  keypresses: it was **discoverability**. A reader who never scrolls to the bottom never learns the
  controls exist, so the page presents figures they chose as fixed properties of the model and the
  hardware — which makes it a claim about what the numbers _are_, not a preference about what the page
  leads with. Measured before the move, at 1440x900: the context slider sat at y=3004 and the memory
  bar it fills at y=602, so the control was 2,402px below its own output. The pixel count is the
  evidence; the misrepresentation is the reason.

  Usage now sits directly under Setup — the landmark's own name since #74, where it stopped being
  "Configuration" and became an `sr-only` heading, which is what `App.test.tsx` and
  `usage-placement.spec.ts` both locate it by. Envelope and Matrix are the last two _output_ panels,
  and deliberately not "the terminal panels": on any MoE selection `Bench.tsx` renders the
  architecture aside after `<Matrix>`, which is a conditional panel and the reason
  `matrix-readout.spec.ts` measures section and document heights rather than a following sibling.

  The roving tab index is untouched and still does the work this entry is about, though not in the
  figure this paragraph first quoted. "15 presses either way" was the walk to the Usage panel, and #66
  moved Usage to the top of the page, so that quantity no longer describes anything: the grid costs
  **one** press to cross whichever end of the page it sits at, and what is worth counting now is the
  page. Two counts, from the two suites, and the gap between them is worth stating exactly:

  - `App.test.tsx` — **41** DOM tab-stop candidates over the whole document, against **1,510**
    without the roving index (41 − 1 + 1,470). That subtrahend is the grid, so it moves with the
    catalog: it was 714 before #77 doubled the model list, and a counterfactual quoting the old one
    is a wrong expected value for whoever reinjects the defect.
  - `e2e/matrix-grid.spec.ts` — **37** real browser stops, inside `<main>`.

  Four apart, from three unrelated causes and not one. **Two** are the KV radio group, which offers
  Tab only its checked member and a `querySelectorAll` all three. The **third** is scope rather than
  semantics: the masthead's copy-link button is a real stop that the browser walk excludes, because it
  sits outside `<main>` and that walk ends when focus leaves. The **fourth** arrived with #139 —
  the calibration textarea sits inside a `hidden` region, which a walk correctly never reaches and a
  selector counts anyway, because `querySelectorAll` knows nothing about visibility. Compare a new
  measurement against the number from the same channel, and against a stated reason for the gap: the
  e2e comment once read "23 against 25 in jsdom" and attributed the whole difference to the radios,
  which was one short and pointed at the wrong mechanism for the missing one.

  **Both bounds moved from 40 to 55 when the four v2 panels landed, and the raise is argued rather
  than nudged** — it is the second one, and the counts went 26 → 41 and 23 → 37 in a single pass.
  The old comment predicted this exact failure and chose a loose bound because of it ("the next
  disclosure would have failed a test named after the grid while nothing about the grid had
  changed"), which is the reason to trust the raise rather than to distrust it. What the bound is
  for, stated so the next person does not have to infer it: **the defect is 1,510, not 41.** Forty
  was an order-of-magnitude line, never a budget, and what it catches is a whole _collection_
  re-entering the sequence — 55 catches that exactly as well, because the failure mode is three
  orders of magnitude away and not one panel away. The two numbers stay equal on purpose, since a
  bound that fires in one channel and not the other is a bug report about the wrong file.

  **The pressure underneath it is real and is not a test problem.** Four panels landed on one page in
  one pass, and a page that keeps adding panels is what to look at before this number is raised a
  third time. Shedding stops was considered and declined: the copy buttons could be one shared button
  at the cost of the reader knowing which command they copied, the provenance links are the
  flags-drift trap #136 names, and the command block's stop is Chrome's own rather than this app's to
  remove.

  **The cost is real and was accepted rather than solved.** At 390px both panels stack, so nine
  controls — about 620px — now precede the first figure, where before there were none. #66 named a
  sticky summary strip as the mitigation and deprioritised it, and the phone spec asserts the honest
  property — the controls are inside the first two screens — rather than a landing-screen claim the
  layout does not make. The slider and the bar _do_ come within one viewport of each other here, 683px
  apart on an 844px screen, which is the laptop test's property holding on a phone; what is not true is
  that either of them is on the first screen. Three source comments that asserted the old geometry
  moved with it, on the reasoning that a comment describing the old layout is how the next reader
  concludes the fix was a mistake.

  **And the spec did not assert the property this paragraph credited it with.** It measured
  `panel.top < 2 x viewport` — the panel _starts_ inside two screens — which stays green with the last
  three sliders below the fold, and below the fold is precisely where growth above Usage would put
  them one control at a time. A one-sided bound on a box whose height is the subject is the same shape
  as the `getClientRects().length === 1` note below: an assertion that cannot fail for the reason it
  was written. It reads the panel's bottom edge now, at 1,401px against the 1,688px bar, so the margin
  is 287px of measurement rather than of slack.

- **A focus indicator is a mark of its own, never a colour swap and never a channel a resting state
  already uses** ([#67](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/67)). The four primary selects —
  Model, Hardware, Quantization, Runtime — removed the outline and replaced it with a 1px border
  colour change measuring **1.95:1 against the unfocused edge**, where SC 2.4.13 asks for 3:1 at a
  2px minimum. `--color-control-border` had been raised to `#646d88` specifically so a control's
  edge cleared 3:1 _before_ focus; the focused state never got the same treatment, so the most
  important controls on the page were the only ones whose indicator you could not see.

  Two more instances came out of the sweep, both of them listed in the issue as already correct:

  - The budget legend drew `focus:ring-1` — 1px, half the minimum, and with the outline suppressed
    it is the whole indicator rather than a decoration on top of one.
  - The Matrix marked its selected square with `ring-2 ring-[accent] ring-offset-1` and lit
    `focus:ring-2 ring-[accent]` on focus: **the same channel, width and colour**, so focusing the
    marked square changed nothing whatsoever. A 1:1 change contrast, which is the select's 1.95:1
    in its most extreme form, and reachable in one click — clicking a cell makes it both the
    selection and the roving tab stop, so the marked square is exactly where Tab lands coming back
    to the grid. Selection is drawn inside the cell now, and focus stays outside it.

  **Moving a mark onto the heatmap changes what it has to contrast against, and the accent was never
  validated there.** Separating the two channels put the selection mark inside the cell, which took
  it off `--color-surface` — where `tokens.ts` measures the accent at 7.14:1 — and onto the ramp,
  where a single-tone accent frame measures **2.00, 1.48, 1.06, 1.38, 2.04, 3.07 and 4.52:1** across
  the seven steps of `sequential`. That is below the 3:1 non-text minimum on **304 of the grid's 408
  squares**, including the default selection at 1.38:1 on `#3987e5`; on `#6da7ec` the two colours sit
  0.022 apart in relative luminance, so the mark was a pure hue difference at 1.06:1 — #67's own
  failure mode, re-shipped as the resting state. The first attempt at this fix did exactly that, and
  the only reason it looked measured is that the browser spec scored the mark against the panel
  behind the cell instead of the fill on top of it.

  So the selected square wears **two tones**: 2px of accent bounded by `--color-surface` on both
  sides — the 2px `border-spacing` outside, a 1px separator inside — which is the dataviz surface
  ring, and the same trick `Envelope.tsx` already used for its "you are here" mark on the same ramp
  ("A ring, not a filled dot: the cell's own colour has to stay readable underneath it"). The
  invariant is _not_ that either tone clears 3:1 everywhere; it is that **one of them always does**:
  the separator on the five light steps (14.26 down to 3.50:1), the accent on the two dark ones where
  the separator disappears into the fill (3.07 and 4.52:1). Worst case 3.07:1, zero squares under the
  bar. Anything drawn on a cell in future — a value label, a comparison marker — inherits this
  obligation and none of the existing measurements, because `--color-accent` is validated against
  `surface` and nothing in `tokens.ts` says a word about the ramp. The separator rides the
  `--tw-shadow` slot rather than a second inset ring because Tailwind composes one box-shadow chain in
  a fixed order — `inset-shadow, inset-ring, ring-offset, ring, shadow` — and only the last slot
  paints _under_ the accent, which is what keeps the accent 2px wide rather than 1px. Spelling a
  bracketed utility out in prose is worth avoiding for its own small reason: Tailwind scans comments
  and Markdown as source, so an example in a sentence compiles to a rule of dead CSS.

  **The mechanism differs by control and the bar does not**, which is the decision rather than an
  oversight. The selects use `outline` where their neighbours use `ring`, because a ring is a
  `box-shadow` and a native `menulist` select is painted by the platform in WebKit — the fix that
  matched the rest of the app would have shipped nothing at all on Safari, and Chromium cannot tell
  you that. What is uniform is 2px and 3:1 against whatever the mark is drawn on, measured per
  surface rather than assumed from the token.

  **Split across both suites, for the reason #52's counting was.** Which indicator a control
  _declares_ is a class-list property, so `App.test.tsx` sweeps all 400-odd focusable elements in a
  second and pins the declared width, colour, and the channel collision — and, because the fill is an
  inline style and the tones are token names, it also does the ramp arithmetic above over every fill
  the grid paints. Whether an indicator _paints_ 2px at 3:1 needs a real stylesheet and a real focus
  ring, and jsdom has neither: that is `e2e/focus-indicators.spec.ts`, which walks the tab sequence
  with Tab rather than `focus()` — the UA ring is `:focus-visible`-gated and a scripted focus does not
  reliably satisfy the heuristic, so a sweep driven by `focus()` reports every slider on the page as
  painting nothing. Two things in that reader are easy to get wrong and both have now been wrong
  once: it exempts `outline-style: auto` from the thickness check, because Chromium reports 1px for a
  dual-tone ring it paints at 2px (asserted to still match something, or the exemption quietly
  becomes the rule), and it scores each layer against the colour that layer actually covers — an
  `inset` shadow over the element's own fill, everything else over the first opaque ancestor. Scoring
  every mark against the ancestor is what certified a 1.06:1 mark as 7.14:1.

- **`pointer: coarse` does not mean "this user can touch the screen".** It describes the _primary_
  pointing device, so a touchscreen laptop, a Surface, or an iPad with a keyboard case reports
  `fine` — and the disclosure toggles dropped back to 16px for someone who can still put a thumb on
  the glass. They use `any-pointer: coarse` now; the Matrix grid deliberately does not, because
  widening it there buys 44px rows on every laptop that merely has a touchscreen, multiplied across
  hundreds of cells, while the toggles cost 28px once per panel and are the accessibility
  affordance.

  **The asymmetry is asserted against the stylesheet rather than the layout**, which is a limitation
  worth recording. A true hybrid cannot be emulated: Playwright's `hasTouch` makes Chromium report a
  touch-_only_ device — both queries true, `any-pointer: fine` absent — and `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`
  over CDP with explicit pointer features is silently ignored. Both measured. So
  `e2e/hybrid-targets.spec.ts` reads the shipped CSSOM and checks the query, the selector and the
  declaration, which is falsifiable and covers the failure an arbitrary Tailwind variant really has:
  compiling to nothing. It has to descend through `CSSGroupingRule` to do it — v4 nests utilities
  inside `@layer`, and a walk that only recursed through `CSSMediaRule` found nothing and passed.
  (#43.)

- **The numeral pair's nowrap cannot be falsified by geometry, and the spec says so.** "67 of 408"
  is short enough that it never breaks on its own at any root size from 32px to 64px — measured,
  not assumed — so `getClientRects().length === 1` is true with the class and true without it. The
  spec asserts the computed style instead. Worth stating because writing the geometry version is
  the obvious move and it would pass against markup with the protection deleted.

- **A probe that filters on a field the type does not have reports a clean sweep over zero cases.**
  Verifying that a serving failure at one user cannot recover at more meant sweeping the catalog, and
  the sweep filtered candidate quants with `runtime.weightFormats.includes(quant.format)`. `QuantSpec`
  has no `format` — the id _is_ the format — so `includes(undefined)` was false for every combination
  and the probe reported perfect monotonicity over **nothing**. It printed the sample count only
  because that had been added on a whim; asserting the property directly would have written a
  confident falsehood into a commit message. Every sweep in this repo now asserts it matched a
  plausible number of cases _before_ trusting its result, which is the same fail-open shape the
  touch-target exemption list is guarded against below.

- **`aria-describedby` is an IDREF _list_, and resolving it as one id fails in the direction that
  passes** ([#74](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/74)). Specs handed the whole attribute to
  `getElementById`, which returns `null` the moment a control carries two ids — so appending a second
  description to a picker would have reported a control that _has_ a note as having none, and every
  "no note runs past two lines" budget in `config-notes.spec.ts` is satisfied by zero lines. The
  resolvers split on whitespace and sum across the elements now. This is the third instance of one
  class in this file — with the `quant.format` probe above and the touch-target exemption list below —
  and the class is worth naming: **a resolver that fails silently makes a spec pass on broken
  markup.** All three failed by finding nothing and reading nothing as compliance, so the general
  guard is the same one: assert the sweep found something before believing what it says about it. Each
  affected spec now also asserts the note's _text_, because a line count alone is one-sided and the
  curated note was in fact dropped from that control once before, taking the 3090's NVLink caveat
  with it.

- **`getBoundingClientRect().top` is the border-box edge, so a padding comparison must add the border.**
  Asserting that an `sr-only` heading takes no grid track meant measuring the first control against
  the panel's content edge, and `panel.top + paddingTop` is short by the border width — which reads as
  the control sitting _lower_ than it does, making the assertion pass with slack it had not earned.
  `borderTopWidth` rides along with `paddingTop` everywhere this is computed.

- **A premise that becomes unsatisfiable when the fix works is not a weak premise — but it cannot also
  be the evidence.** The Matrix's readout reservation — the responsive `min-h` on that paragraph,
  held by `e2e/matrix-readout.spec.ts` — pads a three-line sentence into a four-line
  box, so the test written to prove "two sentences of different height do not move the panel" found
  equal heights once the fix landed and failed on its own precondition. The right shape is to assert
  the _consequence_ here and put the _evidence that the inputs differ_ in a sibling test.

  **The sibling test is owed rather than written, and saying otherwise was this entry making the
  mistake it is about.** The sweep that exists samples every seventh cell and asserts the rendered
  height is positive and no greater than the reservation — but the rendered height already _includes_
  the `min-height`, so a readout whose sentences all fit one line satisfies it, and deleting the
  reservation escapes it. That is evidence of the reservation working, not evidence that the inputs
  differ, which are the two halves this entry exists to separate. What it needs is a natural height
  measured with the reservation lifted, and an assertion that the line counts genuinely differ. It
  belongs with [#102](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/102), which reworks that reservation
  for a 32px root and has to measure the unreserved wrapping anyway.

- **Reflow tests measure the panel; the page is a different question.** The Matrix readout was moved to
  be the panel's last child so its height could not push the legend, and the commit claimed "nothing
  follows it". At the time `Bench.tsx` rendered the Usage section immediately after `<Matrix>`, so a
  height change still moved that panel: the claim was verified inside the component and written about
  the document.

  **The obvious repair — assert against the following section — is the one the current spec
  deliberately rejects**, and the reason is that #66 moved Usage above the figures. What follows
  `<Matrix>` now is the MoE aside, which is conditional, so there is no stable next section to measure
  against and a spec naming one would go quiet on the scenarios where the aside does not render. The
  canary in `e2e/matrix-readout.spec.ts` is therefore the two quantities that cannot stop being
  downstream of the readout: the **Matrix section's own height**, which is where the growth would be,
  and the **document's height**, which is everything below it whatever that turns out to be. The
  general lesson survives the move — measure past the boundary the claim is about — but "the following
  section" was a fact about one layout, not the rule.

- **A locator re-resolves, so an interaction that renames its target invalidates it.** A disclosure
  toggle's accessible name _is_ its label, and clicking it turns "Show the full hardware note" into
  "Hide…". Reading `aria-controls` off the `/show…/` locator after the click waited the full timeout
  for a button that no longer existed, and reported the failure against the region lookup two lines
  later — pointing at the wrong code entirely. Read what you need from an element before the gesture
  that changes it.

- **Pick the viewport the defect needs, then assert the defect is reachable there.** Two specs in the
  sweep passed against unfixed markup for want of this. A sticky-placement test written at 1280x900
  could not fail, because the grid is 745px tall and the readout is on screen anyway at that height;
  it needed 600px. A stress-font precondition measured `'Not measured'`, a short string of wide
  lowercase letters where a proportional sans and a monospace agree most — 1.191 on macOS and **1.019
  on the CI runner**, under its own 1.05 floor, so the guard failed the build for typography rather
  than layout. It probes `'Inline code completion'` now, the string `reflow.spec.ts` uses. That pair of
  ratios also measures something worth keeping: Courier New is metric-aliased on both platforms, so
  1.191/1.019 puts **the Linux runner's default sans about 17% wider than SF**.

- **A touch-target spec that names its controls will always be out of date.** The old one measured
  the three Matrix toggles it knew about, and three 16px buttons on other surfaces went unnoticed
  until someone looked (#29). It sweeps now: every pointer target on the page, with the `sr-only`
  radios resolved to the label that actually receives the tap, and both disclosures opened first —
  half the page's controls do not exist until something opens them, including the Envelope's table.
  Exemptions are data with a written reason, and each is asserted to still match an element, since
  an exception list is the one part of a sweep that fails open.

- **A row that declares its own grid is a table that measures its columns once per row**
  ([#70](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/70)). The workload strip put
  its three column tracks on each `<li>`, so every row was its own grid container and the middle
  `auto` track was sized from that row's own label — the reason column, the third one, started at
  444, 446, 457, 475, 495, 499 and 503px at 1440. Columns 1 and 2 lined up because the first track is
  fixed, and _that_ is what makes the third read as a column rather than as prose. It carries the
  panel's argument: seven archetypes, seven answers, and the written reasons are what explain the
  differences, so they have to be scannable against each other.

  A subgrid on the row, with the tracks moved to the `<ul>`. Not `display: contents`, which is the
  same idea and the tempting one-liner: a row that generates no box is a `<li>` shipping browsers drop
  from the accessibility tree, and `order` applies among siblings of _one_ container, so dissolving
  the rows would sort all twenty-one cells into a block of labels, a block of status words and a block
  of reasons at the stacked width. The row therefore keeps its own two-column grid below `sm` and only
  hands its columns back above it.

  **The row's own template has to be `max-sm:`-scoped, and that is the silent part.** Subgrid is
  Baseline widely available — Firefox 71, Safari 16, Chrome and Edge 117 — but it is _not_ inside
  Vite's default build target, which floors at Chrome 111 (`baseline-widely-available` resolves to
  chrome111/edge111/firefox114/safari16.4), so Chrome and Edge 111–116 are browsers this build targets
  and the feature is missing from. There `grid-template-columns: subgrid` is invalid and dropped —
  and anything the row declares _unconditionally_ survives, so an unscoped two-column template leaves
  the row a two-column grid at every width while `sm:order-none` cancels the stacking: `● Yes` renders
  before the label, which is neither of the two layouts the component supports. Verified by serving
  the built CSS with the subgrid value invalidated: tracks of 269.016px and 780.984px, status word at
  x=189, label at x=470, reason wrapped to a second line at x=189. Scoped to `max-sm:`, the same
  browsers get a row with no template — one implicit 1062px column, three cells stacked in DOM order,
  which is the order they read in left to right. `App.test.tsx` pins the scope, because no browser in
  CI can show the fallback.

  **The trap is that fixing it makes the obvious precondition vacuous.** With the tracks shared,
  every label _cell_ is exactly one width — the column's — so a spec that reads
  `getBoundingClientRect().width` off the label to prove the labels differ from each other reports
  0px of spread and fails on the fixed markup. It has to measure the glyphs: a `Range` over the
  cell's contents. Written the wrong way first and caught by running it, which is the argument for
  running a geometry spec against both states rather than one.

  **Swept rather than assumed.** A throwaway probe walked every container on the page whose children
  are same-tagged multi-child flex or grid boxes, at 640/768/1024/1440 across three scenarios, and
  reported the spread of each nth child's offset. One true instance — this one. The two candidates
  worth naming both measure clean: the Telemetry tiles are three independent flex columns whose
  internal rows could rag on the row axis and do not (0px at every width), and the BudgetBar and
  Envelope legends are wrap-flow rows where a shared column is not the reading. The Matrix and the
  two disclosure tables are real `<table>`s, which is this fix by other means.

- **A bar that scales to its own overflow stops measuring anything, and the answer is words rather
  than a broken axis** ([#73](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/73)). `scale = max(used,
ceiling)` keeps an over-budget stack on screen, which is right and stays. What it means is that the
  ceiling's _position_ is a function of the overshoot: DeepSeek V3 at Q4_K_M on one 5090 at 128K and
  8 users draws 448 GiB against a 31 GiB ceiling, so the rule lands 6.9% from the left edge and the
  panel reads "nearly full" instead of "fourteen times over". The bar's own docblock promised the
  opposite — an overflow region beyond the line, "because it turned red does not tell you by how
  much" — and past about 3x the budget is the sliver and the overflow is the entire picture.

  Three things about the fix are worth keeping. **The multiple is stated past 3x and deliberately not
  below it** (`OVERSHOOT_STATED`): at 1.1x "over by 2.2 GiB" and "1.1x the ceiling" are one fact said
  twice, and a clause on every overflow is a clause people stop reading — including at 14x, where it
  is the only thing carrying the scale. **The overshoot is `used / ceiling` computed in the panel**,
  not `placement.utilization`, because it is exactly the reciprocal of where the rule is drawn
  (`ceiling / scale`) — the sentence and the line are two readings of one expression and cannot come
  apart. **A broken axis was rejected** rather than overlooked: it is a real cost for a case a clause
  already covers, and the header states the true figures throughout.

  The other half was legibility, and it is **broader than the issue's 14x framing**: the rule is
  drawn on top of a fill at _every_ overshoot, not merely a large one. Once the bar overflows, `scale`
  is `used`, so the segments occupy the whole width and no empty track is left anywhere for the
  reference line to sit on — at 1.1x it falls at 91%, inside the amber cache that took the
  configuration over. The overshoot only decides _which_ fill.

  The class check is the useful part of the rest, and it split into two classes that look like one.
  On **separation**, the rule was the only overlay mark in the app drawn straight onto a fill — the
  Envelope's "you are here" ring strokes a 1px background counter-line under itself and the Matrix's
  selected cell carries `ring-offset` in the surface colour, so both were already right, and the house
  idiom was already "separate an overlapping mark with surface, never with more ink". The rule now sits
  in a track-coloured halo one `marks.gap` wide on each side, the same mechanism the segments already
  use between themselves.

  On **identity**, all three were wrong, and scoping the first pass to "the only mark in this bar"
  is what hid it: every fill in the app had a legend key and not one overlay did. The Envelope's ring
  was named only inside the canvas `aria-label` — so a screen-reader user was told what it was and a
  sighted reader met a double ring with nothing on the page saying so — and the Matrix's selection
  ring had only `aria-current` plus the accent hue, which is a channel a legend does not get to rely
  on. All three are keyed now, each only while its mark is drawn, which for the Matrix means "while a
  cell is marked at all": `isCurrent` is false for every cell on a linked rig, since the grid is
  scored at one device. A legend is the identity channel that does not depend on the mark being
  legible, which is exactly the property an overlay cannot promise.

  **Verification splits, and the e2e half records what it cannot claim.** The clause and the key are
  DOM and are asserted in Vitest against a reinjected defect in each direction, including the
  negative: dropping the threshold to 1 fails the 1.1x test. Position and halo are geometry, which
  jsdom reports as 0, so `e2e/budget-overshoot.spec.ts` measures them in a browser — at two scenarios
  (14x on a 5090, 2x on an M3 Ultra), because one position cannot tell a measurement from a constant,
  and with the expected offset derived from the header's own figures rather than written as 6.9%. What
  it does **not** do is read pixels: "distinguishable against the fill beneath it" would mean decoding
  a screenshot, so it asserts the mechanism — halo width, halo colour taken off the bar, the rule
  still at the true position — which fails if the bare 2px line comes back. Same shape of compromise
  as `hybrid-targets.spec.ts` makes for the pointer queries.

  **Three things review caught, all of them the same lesson: a rule stated in one channel is not
  applied until every channel states it.** (1) The table still printed `percent(bytes / ceiling)`, so
  the issue's own URL read "Weights 379 GiB / 1222%" — the exact form `multiple` exists to replace, in
  the channel that exists "for anyone who cannot use the bar" and therefore has no shape to fall back
  on. It switches at the same `OVERSHOOT_STATED`, so the two channels cannot disagree about whether a
  ratio is large, and **per row rather than per column**: the stack overshoots, the rows do not, and
  0.7 GiB of overhead against a 31 GiB ceiling is 0.02x, which `multiple` prints as "0x" — a real
  quantity rendered as nothing, the failure `percent`'s own `<1%` floor exists to prevent. Mixed forms
  in one column are the cost of not printing a wrong number. (2) The rule's ink was `border-l-2` while
  its halo was sized from `marks.lineWidth`; two literals for one weight means a token bumped to 3
  centres a 2px line inside 7px and moves the rule half a pixel off the ceiling, which the e2e
  position check's 3px tolerance would pass. Both now come from the token. (3) The e2e halo test
  asserted containment unconditionally, which the code does not promise: a fixed-width mark centred on
  a position within a gap of either edge is clipped by the bar, so a stack 0.5% over loses the right
  1–4px of separation and one hundreds of times over loses the left. The position is what is kept —
  clamping it inward would draw the ceiling where the ceiling is not — so the assertion now names the
  overhang and its own precondition instead of implying a guarantee.

- **`toBeVisible()` does not catch `sr-only`, which is the one thing it keeps getting reached for.**
  #179 asked in as many words for a Playwright assertion that would fail if the model-order sentence
  were later moved back into screen-reader-only text. Written as specified it would not have:
  Playwright calls an element visible when it has a non-empty bounding box and no `visibility: hidden`,
  and `sr-only` is a 1px clip rather than `display: none` — so the hidden paragraph passed
  `toBeVisible()` on both mutation runs. The clipped box was also **9px tall, not the 1px the class
  implies**, because `pt-2` on the same element outlives `sr-only`'s `padding: 0`; a height threshold
  picked from the class alone would have been one Tailwind ordering away from passing as well.
  `e2e/catalog-order.spec.ts` asserts geometry instead — width > 100 (523 painted against 1 hidden),
  height ≥ 16 (41.5 against 9), and no overflow clipping — and is mutation-checked in both directions,
  the red run reading "the Model picker's order caption is 1px wide, which is not a sentence". The
  jsdom half cannot help here and says so: `AppCatalog.test.tsx` can assert the paragraph is outside a
  `<caption>` and carries no `sr-only` class, but it cannot compute visibility, so the exact
  regression #179 exists to prevent would have passed the test written to prevent it. Any future
  "is it really visible" assertion in this suite has the same trap under it.

- **A sweep that was free at four routes is a CI failure at 199.** `App.hydration.test.tsx` hydrated
  every route the build writes; at 199 that is 13 s locally and roughly 70 s on the runner, against
  a 30 s per-test limit — and `vite.config.ts` argues at length that the limit is not the thing to
  raise, because "a test approaching this is a test rendering the full grid for a claim that does
  not need it". It does not need the product: a mismatch is the client and the server disagreeing,
  both compute the tree from the same coerced `Config`, and the one place they can diverge is the
  path parse — which `routes.test.ts` round-trips over all 199 in milliseconds. So the hydration
  suite now takes one route per _shape_ of tree, derived from the fields that switch a branch
  (tier, device class, device status, tunable ceiling, attention kind, MoE), which is ~21 routes
  and 1.4 s and grows by itself when the catalog gains a combination. The exhaustive figure check
  moved to `src/prerender/page.test.ts`, where it is the same `missingFigures` the build enforces.
- **The regression guard for "the site went back to being a shell" cannot read `dist/`.** CI runs
  `npm test` before `npm run build`, so a test that read the built output would find nothing on a
  fresh checkout — and both ways around that are worse than composing the page in the test:
  skipping when `dist/` is absent is a guard that silently does not run where it matters, and
  asserting against whatever `dist/` holds makes a green suite depend on a build that may be hours
  old. `src/prerender/page.test.ts` composes from the committed `index.html` and the real render;
  `e2e/prerendered.spec.ts` is what reads genuinely built files, because the browser suite always
  builds first.

**Catalog figures the UI quotes**

- **Three quantities are called "active params" and two of them are wrong for any given sentence.**
  `activeParams` is the _published_ convention, which is not one rule: `publishedActiveParams` returns
  `totalParams` outright on a dense model — embedding and all — and only on an MoE builds an
  embedding-subtracted dense residual back up with the routed share. So on a multimodal model it
  includes the non-language towers a token never touches, and on an untied dense one it includes an
  input embedding decode never reads. On a **tied, text-only dense** row it is exactly right, because
  a tied table _is_ the output projection and a full vocab matmul runs every step: Llama 3.2 3B,
  Qwen3 4B and granite-4.1-8b all have total, published and dense identical to the digit. The rule is
  not "dense rows are wrong" — it is that the published convention answers a different question and
  coincides with the physical one only where nothing is being excluded. `activeDenseParams`
  is the always-active dense part and excludes the routed experts. `effectiveActiveParams(model, b)`
  is `activeDenseParams + expertParams * expertFraction(model, b)`, and it is the physical count — the
  one the Bench's aside has to print, since that sentence says a token "routes through" a figure and
  then attributes the decode rate to it. It printed the first, was "corrected" to the second, and both
  were caught in review.

  **`speed.ts` divides by neither, and that is worth stating precisely because the aside sounds like
  it does.** `estimateDecode` reads `activeWeightBytes(model, quant, batch)`, which prices the dense
  and expert halves at their own widths rather than blending them — the correction recorded under
  **Engine** above, and about a factor of two on an expert-only scheme like MXFP4, where the dense
  tensors stay BF16. `effectiveActiveParams` is the parameter count behind that byte figure, not the
  divisor itself.

  **The two errors are per-model, and neither generalises.** Written as invariants they would be
  false in both directions:

  - Published against physical, at batch 1: they are **identical** on every text-only MoE in the
    catalog, so the gap opens only where non-language towers sit inside `activeParams` — and there it
    runs in _both_ directions. Mistral Small 4 publishes 6.524B against a 6.096B basis (7.0% high);
    Command A+ publishes 24.403B against 24.981B (2.3% _low_).
  - Dense against physical: `activeDenseParams` is low on every MoE, by a ratio that spans the
    catalog — 1.91x on GLM-4.7-Flash, 2.99x on Kimi K2 (10.6B where a token traverses 31.75B), and
    8.65x on Mixtral, whose dense stack is tiny beside eight experts. "A factor of three" is Kimi's
    number and nobody else's.

  **A test for this has to pick a model where the two bases differ, and that is the whole trick.** On
  an _untied_ text-only MoE they coincide exactly — gpt-oss-20b is 3.614B either way, as are
  Qwen3-30B-A3B, Mixtral and GLM-4.7-Flash — so a test written against one passes whichever figure the
  component prints. `App.test.tsx` selects on the numeric gap rather than on "is an MoE", which is
  what makes it right for the reason rather than by luck.

  **The rows that satisfy it today are the two multimodal MoEs, and that is a snapshot rather than the
  rule.** A tied _text-only_ MoE would discriminate just as well, with no tower involved, because the
  MoE branch subtracts a tied embedding the physical basis keeps — so a maintainer who reads "it has
  to be multimodal" would reject a perfectly good fixture. The rule is the gap; the list is today's
  catalog.

- **A row identified by capacity or price must not carry another configuration's compute.** Filed
  against one row and live on four. Apple sells most SoCs in two GPU bins and offers the same memory
  with both, so capacity does not identify the part: the $999 MacBook Air ships 8 GPU cores and carried
  the 10-core rate; the 64 GiB M1 Max, the 192 GiB M2 Ultra and the 96 GiB M3 Ultra each carried their
  larger bin's. Each overstated prefill 25–33% on a machine somebody owns. Every Apple row now states
  its core count — including the rows where capacity _does_ pin the bin, because "capacity implies it"
  is precisely the reasoning that was wrong four times — and `catalog.test.ts` pins the convention
  rather than the values: `fp16` must equal the stated core count times the generation's per-core rate,
  which is constant within a generation (the M4 family is 0.85 across Air, Pro and Max).

  **Where the bin is written is not cosmetic.** `headerColumns()` keeps a trailing parenthesised
  qualifier whenever a name-stem repeats, so putting the bin in the _name_ of the three M3 Ultra rows
  or the two Mac mini M4 Pro rows takes the longest rotated header label from 25 characters to 38 and
  regresses #64. Those rows carry it in the note; unique-stem rows carry it in the name, where the
  header strips the qualifier anyway.

**Verdicts**

- **Grade a tier on the measurement its own sentence quotes, and on the scenario it recommends.**
  The long-context tight tier admits a machine holding 64K and was timing it on the archetype's full
  128K request — a prompt that rig has nowhere to put, and prefill is quadratic, so the impossible
  request routinely failed the tier that had just admitted it on capacity. The half-fix was worse
  than the bug: pointing the _reasons_ at the window the machine holds while the _predicate_ still
  read the reduced job meant a rig holding 160K was graded on its 64K measurement while the sentence
  beside it reported 1046s against a 600s bar. One value in both.

  That was one instance of a class, and three more were live in the same file (#9, #10, #11 — fixed
  together, since fixing them apart is how the first one took two attempts):

  - **Serving had no latency term at all.** Capacity and decode were the whole grade, so a
    deployment where every user waits minutes for a first token read as healthy: Llama 3.1 8B
    Q4_K_M on an EPYC 9654 at four users fits, decodes ~40 tok/s each, and takes ~165s to read the
    four 2K prompts. The gap _grew_ when `estimatePrefill` learned about concurrency — the estimate
    became right and nothing on this path read it. Bars are 10s and 30s, looser than chat's 2s and
    5s because a shared deployment queues by design.
  - **The agent tiers recommended a session and measured a turn.** Both read a rate taken at the
    archetype's 16K turn while their capacity bars endorsed the rig for a 32K or 64K session. 8B at
    BF16 on one 4090 under vLLM: 49.7 tok/s at the turn, ~8.6 once its own 64K session is resident
    and the weights spill to make room — below even the tight tier's 15. Fixed the long-context way,
    with one `agentMeasured` at whichever session the rig can hold, read by both tiers and every
    sentence. The consequence is deliberate: a rig that holds 64K has its _tight_ tier timed at 64K
    too. The reduced figure is for machines that cannot hold more, not a lenient reading for
    machines that can — and splitting it puts the grade and the sentence back on different
    measurements the moment `good` fails and `tight` holds.

    The first attempt at this reproduced the defect inside its own fix, which is worth knowing
    about: like every archetype it floors the evaluation at the configured context, so above 64K
    the tier's _bar_ and the _evaluated_ session are different numbers — and the new sentences
    printed the bar. At a 128K slider the row read "10 tok/s with a 64K session in the cache", a
    grade taken at twice the session it named, and the 64K it claimed would have been `tight`.
    Caught in review, not by the suite. If a sentence names a scenario, that name has to come from
    the same expression the estimate was called with.

    What the session bought was, at first, on the decode axis and only there. `estimatePrefill`
    derived its linear and attention work from `promptTokens` alone, so the context reached it
    through the placement or not at all: on the 4090 above, turn and session TTFT differed by 1.5%
    — the streaming term — and on a resident rig they were identical to the digit. The agent latency
    bars were a turn's prompt pass priced on the session's placement, which is a 16K prompt
    attending over _itself_. Fixed in #23; see **A cached prefix** under **Engine**.

  - **The RAG sentence printed a machine-wide rate beside one document's time.** See the
    `prefillTokensPerSec` note under **Engine**. Two figures in one sentence have to divide into
    each other, and at eight users these were off by eight.

  The lesson generalises past this file: a predicate and its sentence are one claim, and the
  scenario is part of the measurement, not context around it.

- **A tight verdict must name the bar it missed.** Once the fail-level branches are exhausted it is
  easy to fall through to a positive fallback, which prints healthy figures beside a downgrade and
  explains nothing — "139 tok/s over 40K of context, 4.0s per turn" is three good numbers and no
  reason. The five tiers with more than one `good` bar now state whichever they miss, through one
  shared builder; five hand-written copies of that sentence is how two of them came to disagree.
  Completion's 0.4s bar is described rather than printed — at sub-second scale a limit and a near
  miss are a tenth apart and read as the same magnitude side by side. Chat's 2s and rag's 5s are
  far enough from their measurements to state plainly, and do.
- **`impossible` and `headroomBytes <= 0` are different claims.** The second means the fully
  resident placement is over budget; only the first means capacity is genuinely gone. Conflating
  them told users that one more concurrent user had "nowhere to go" when a partial offload still
  admits another, more slowly — and told a Mac to spill weights on a machine with no tier to spill
  to. `impossible` is computed once in `planPlacement`; the budget bar and Telemetry both take
  `canOffload` from the Bench, so two panels a few pixels apart cannot describe one placement
  differently — which they did.

**Catalog**

- **`safetensors.total` counts tensor _elements_, not parameters, and its derived dtype summary is
  not revision-stable.** True for FP8, false for MXFP4. The unchanged gpt-oss-120b weight revision
  uploaded on 4 August 2025 reported `U8` as 33/32 of logical experts in the 3 August 2026 refresh,
  then as exactly 1x two days later; gpt-oss-20b still reports 33/32. Pinning the Git revision did
  not pin that server-computed interpretation.

  Accepting both ratios by themselves would weaken the guard enough to admit an ordinary UINT8
  checkpoint and silently discard its dense parameters. The generator now reads every pinned shard
  header for an MXFP4 seed and proves the actual layout instead: each layer has `gate_up_proj` and
  `down_proj` `U8` block/scale pairs; each block's final 16 bytes hold 32 FP4 values; its preceding
  dimensions exactly match one scale byte per block; no other packed tensor is present; and the
  reconstructed count equals the analytic routed-expert count. Only then may the API use either
  observed 1x or 33/32 summary. For gpt-oss-120b that is 57,330,892,800 block bytes plus
  3,583,180,800 scale bytes representing 114,661,785,600 logical expert parameters, alongside
  2,167,371,072 BF16 parameters. The source evidence is the pinned
  [`model.safetensors.index.json`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b/blob/8c0580383cb1e6a9157669336ade6797a024cd9a/model.safetensors.index.json),
  its shard headers, OpenAI's
  [`weights.py`](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/blob/243a1b02767da73bd2e3975be250afa801635866/gpt_oss/torch/weights.py),
  and the repository's unchanged [commit
  history](https://huggingface.co/api/models/openai/gpt-oss-120b/commits/main).

- **Multi-Token Prediction modules inflate reported totals** (DeepSeek V3/R1 by ~13B, GLM-4.5-Air
  by ~4B) and inference never loads them. Detected via `num_nextn_predict_layers` and _refused_,
  not estimated; the seed list carries the published figure with a written reason.
- **There is a third attention family in the wild, and the generator refuses it rather than
  flattening it into GQA** ([#76](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/76)). `deriveAttention`
  knew two, and any model whose layer stack mixes attention with linear or state-space layers fell
  through to the GQA branch and was catalogued as if _every_ layer cached keys and values.
  Qwen3-Next-80B is 12 attention layers of 48, so it derived at 96.0 KiB/token against a true 24.0 —
  12.0 GiB against 3.0 at 128K, the README's own failure mode pointed the other way.
  granite-4.0-h-small is 4 of 40, which is 10x.

  **Two guards looked like they would catch it and did not**, which is the part worth keeping.
  Qwen3-Next carries `num_attention_heads`, `num_key_value_heads` and `head_dim` exactly where GQA
  expects them, so the branch reads as a clean hit with no signal that 36 layers were just charged
  for a cache they never allocate. And `deriveLayerWindows` _did_ refuse a `layer_types` array it
  could not trust — but its filter was `t.includes('sliding')`, so Granite's all-`mamba` array
  matched nothing, `sliding.length === 0` returned `undefined`, and every layer read as full
  attention. **An unrecognised layer type is the same defect as a missing one, one axis over**; the
  vocabulary is closed now (`full_attention`, `attention`, `sliding_attention`) and anything else
  throws.

  **The family presents under at least eight spellings, the issue named two, and the first draft of
  the guard enumerated four and believed that was all of them.** Do not trust a count here. What the
  guard matches, and why it is shaped that way:

  | Spelling                                                         | Model                      | Matched by             |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `full_attention_interval` + `linear_*`, no per-layer array       | Qwen3-Next-80B             | exact key + `^linear_` |
  | `layer_types: ["mamba", ...]` + `mamba_d_*`                      | Granite 4.0-h-small        | vocabulary + `^mamba_` |
  | `hybrid_override_pattern` + `mamba_state_dim` / `mamba_head_dim` | Nemotron-H, Nemotron-Nano  | exact key + `^mamba_`  |
  | `attn_type_list` (per-layer `1`/`0`)                             | MiniMax-M1                 | per-entry test         |
  | nested `linear_attn_config.full_attn_layers`                     | Kimi-Linear-48B            | `^linear_`             |
  | `full_attn_idxs` + `conv_L_cache`, no per-layer array            | LFM2-1.2B, LFM2-350M       | exact keys             |
  | `layer_types: ["conv", ...]`                                     | LFM2-2.6B, LFM2-8B-A1B     | vocabulary             |
  | `mb_per_layer`                                                   | Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning | exact key              |

  **The lesson is that an enumerated list of exact key names is a list of the configs its author
  happened to open.** The first draft listed thirteen and was already incomplete against configs
  fetched the same afternoon: Granite declares `mamba_chunk_size` / `mamba_conv_bias` /
  `mamba_proj_bias` beside the six that were on it, Nemotron-Nano spells the same block
  `mamba_state_dim` / `mamba_head_dim` / `mamba_num_heads` and shares **no** exact name with
  Granite's spelling, and Kimi-Linear puts its whole Kimi-Delta block inside one nested
  `linear_attn_config` object where a flat lookup sees nothing at all — so Kimi derived as clean
  27-layer MLA, 30.375 KiB/token against a true 7.875, 3.86x, on a model whose headline claim is a
  75%-smaller KV cache. So the guard matches **key prefixes** (`^linear_`, `^mamba_`) plus the
  handful of names that carry no generalisable prefix, and the prefixes are verified against all 17
  seeds: none matches, so this rejects nothing already in the product.

  `attn_type_list` is the one entry that has to _admit_ something — M2's list is all `1`, so M2
  really is full attention throughout and a guard keyed on the key's presence would have rejected
  the model that turned out not to be a hybrid. `layer_types` length is `!==` rather than `<` for the
  same reason the entries are: a longer array and `num_hidden_layers` disagree about the stack, and
  slicing chose one silently. And the split-count clause fires only when the config states a
  count _and_ the count is a genuine split: `full_attention_interval: 1` is legal and means every
  layer attends, which otherwise produced "48 of 48 layers attend and cache; the other 0 hold a
  recurrent state" — one sentence contradicting itself, the failure this file's own rule about
  predicates and their prose exists to prevent.

  **Chunked attention is a fourth window convention and needed its own guard, not a vocabulary
  entry.** Leaving `chunked_attention` out of `LAYER_TYPES` does not refuse Llama 4: Scout and
  Maverick ship no `layer_types` at all, so the vocabulary never runs and all 48 layers read as full
  attention — 192.0 KiB/token, 24.0 GiB at 128K, against 7.125 for the real 12-global /
  36-chunked-at-8192 split. 3.4x. **A closed vocabulary only fires for configs that use the key it is
  a vocabulary for.** `attention_chunk_size` is now its own refusal. Note what is deliberately _not_
  the signal: `cache_implementation: "hybrid"` is on `unsloth/gemma-3-12b-it` and `-27b-it`, two
  shipped seeds whose windows derive correctly from `sliding_window_pattern`, so guarding on it would
  have refused two rows that are already right — a fixture in the test file carries the key for
  exactly that reason. And unlike the linear stacks, Llama 4's split _is_ derivable (`no_rope_layers`
  is 48 entries of 1/0, one global layer every fourth); what is not derivable is how many tokens a
  chunked layer's cache holds, because the mask is block-diagonal rather than trailing and residency
  comes from the runtime's chunked-cache implementation. That is what [#77](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/77)
  needs to settle before Scout can be seeded — the refusal is what makes that visible instead of
  shipping a 3.4x row.

  **Refused rather than derived, deliberately, and this is the decision to reopen with new
  information.** Pricing a hybrid properly means a third `AttentionCore` kind carrying the per-layer
  split _and_ the block's constant state term, which `kv.ts` would dispatch on the way it already
  dispatches MLA. Only the first half is in `config.json`: the state's shape is specific to the block
  (DeltaNet's `num_v_heads * head_k_dim * head_v_dim` plus its conv window, Mamba-2's
  `n_heads * d_head * d_state` plus its own) and its width is set by the runtime rather than by
  `torch_dtype` — llama.cpp keeps recurrent state in fp32. Adding the field and filling it with a
  plausible figure would put an invented number inside the fix for an invented number, and a field is
  an invitation: that is exactly how `measuredBandwidthGBs` came to exist. So the error carries the
  evidence instead — which layers cache, which do not, and the key that said so — and adding one of
  these models is a real piece of work rather than a seed-list edit.

  **DeepSeek V3.2-Exp is refused on the same doctrine and a different quantity.** Its capacity
  derives correctly through the existing MLA path; what is wrong is that the lightning indexer keeps
  an `index_n_heads * index_head_dim` cache nothing here counts, and its main attention reads at most
  `index_topk` selected positions rather than everything before it. Right about the latent and
  silently short by the indexer is not a smaller version of deriving both.

  **The refusal also has to be _reached_, and it was not.** `deriveStackShape` ran first, and
  Qwen3-Next ships an MTP module under an `mtp.` prefix — so seeded, it was refused for 1,553
  unclassified tensors instead: a true statement about a different problem, pointing whoever read it
  at `LANGUAGE_PREFIXES` rather than at the layer split. Both derivations read `config.json` alone
  and now run before anything that touches the network again, which also saves a dozen range
  requests on a model that was never going to be admitted. Verified by seeding all four models named
  here: Qwen3-Next, Granite 4 and V3.2-Exp each refuse with their own reason, and MiniMax-M2 is
  admitted at 228.7B.

  **What is still not covered, so the next session does not have to re-derive it.** The refusals are
  the floor, not the fix: no model in the table above can be _added_ until the third `AttentionCore`
  kind exists. Llama 4 needs a chunked-attention window term. `attn_type_list`'s non-`1` values are
  refused without being read, so a future list using `2` for something benign would cost a false
  refusal. Nothing here reads `ssm_cfg`, the raw `state-spaces/mamba` spelling, because no live
  config checked carried it — if one appears it will refuse only if it also carries a `mamba_*` key.
  The list of spellings is open by construction; treat any claim that it is complete, including this
  one, as unverified until re-probed against live `config.json` files.

  **And the reason all of this was untested is mechanical**: `build-catalog.ts` called `main()` at
  module scope, so importing it started seventeen rounds of network fetches and no test could reach a
  single derivation. It carries `catalog-diff.ts`'s guard now, and `scripts/build-catalog.test.ts`
  pins both the refusals and the five shapes the shipped catalog is actually built from — the second
  half mattering as much as the first, since a tightened vocabulary is exactly the kind of change
  that quietly rejects the models already in the product.

  One thing the tests get wrong easily: a refusal test whose pattern is loose enough to match
  `require()`'s "could not determine \<field\> from config.json" passes whether or not the guard
  exists. The headline Qwen3-Next test shipped with `/could not|declares|refus/i` and would have
  stayed green with `refuseLinearStack` deleted. Match the guard's own wording, and read the
  before-figures out of what `deriveAttention` returns for the same fields with the hybrid keys
  removed — arithmetic on literals beside a refusal is documentation, not a test.

- **Three list orders were deliberate, load-bearing and stated nowhere**
  ([#79](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/79)). Nothing sorts `devices.json`, `QUANTS` or
  `RUNTIMES` — every surface renders the file as written — so the order was a convention living only
  in whoever last edited it. That is a silent-breakage shape rather than a cosmetic one: a plausible
  "tidy the list" edit regroups it against itself and no test, type or review notices. The order is
  now stated in `CLAUDE.md` and in each file's docblock, and split by whether a machine can check it.
  `catalog.test.ts` enforces what is structural — rows grouped by `class`, a vendor's rows contiguous
  within a class — and `$comment-order` carries what is not.

  **The unenforceable half is the half worth writing down.** Within a vendor the rule is
  newest-generation-leading and largest-bin-first _inside a tiered ladder_, but newest-released-first
  where a product line is not a ladder — which is why the datacenter GPUs read B200, H200, L40S,
  H100, A100 rather than grouping Hopper together. No assertion distinguishes that from a mistake, so
  a test asserting it would be asserting a snapshot. Stating it is the only available guard.

  **Grouping is rendered by adjacency, so the component cannot own the order.** `<optgroup>` is a run
  of contiguous options, so the picker labels each option with its group and splits on _change_ of
  label. A list whose groups are interleaved therefore renders as two `<optgroup>`s carrying the same
  heading instead of being tidied into one — deliberately, because the alternative is filtering the
  list three times, which would silently make the component the authority on an order `devices.json`
  is supposed to state. The honest rendering makes a broken order visible; the tidy one hides it.

- **`activeParams` is the _published_ convention, not the physical one — and on a dense row it is
  simply `totalParams`.** `publishedActiveParams` returns the total outright when there is no MoE
  derivation, so the embedding is subtracted only on the MoE branch, where the dense residual is
  rebuilt and the routed share added back. It is what reconciles every derived figure with its
  vendor's, and it is the wrong basis for decode wherever the two conventions **exclude different
  things**. Three ways they can, and the third is the one two drafts of this paragraph missed:

  - a **non-language tower**, which the published figure includes and a token never touches;
  - an **untied input embedding** on a dense row, which the published figure includes — there it is
    simply `totalParams` — and decode never reads;
  - a **tied input embedding on an MoE**, which the published figure _subtracts_ (the MoE branch does
    so unconditionally) and `activeDenseParams` correctly keeps, because a tied table is the output
    projection and is read in full every step.

  That last one is live: Command A+ is a tied multimodal MoE where the omitted 1.074B table outweighs
  the included 0.495B tower, which is the whole of why its published figure is 0.578B _low_ where
  Mistral Small 4's is 7% high. And it means a future tied text-only MoE would disagree with no tower
  involved at all — so the derivation is `nonLanguageParams` and `tiedEmbeddings` **crossed with
  whether the row is an MoE**, not either field alone.

  Everywhere else they agree to the digit, and that list is longer than it looks: every _untied_
  text-only MoE — gpt-oss, the Qwen3 MoEs, Mixtral, GLM, the DeepSeek rows — and every tied text-only
  dense row. Stated this way round because the invariant a maintainer needs is _when to distrust the
  published figure_, and "every MoE" would have them replacing correct values.

  As the catalog stands, a snapshot of the rule rather than a list to trust: **Command A+** (tied MoE
  plus tower), **Mistral Small 4** (untied MoE plus tower), **every Gemma 3 row and Ministral 3 3B**
  (tied dense plus tower — Ministral publishes 3.849B against a 3.429B basis on a 0.420B encoder, and
  it is not a Gemma, which is how it went missing from an earlier draft), and **the untied dense
  rows** on the embedding.
  The engine reads `activeDenseParams`:
  - the embedding is subtracted only when **untied**. A tied table _is_ the output projection —
    a full vocab matmul every step — so subtracting it understates Gemma 3 12B by 5%.
  - **tied-ness comes from the absence of an `lm_head.weight` tensor**, never from
    `config.tie_word_embeddings`. That key is undefined on both Gemma 3 repos despite them being
    tied; trusting it drops a 1.0B table decode does read.
  - **non-text towers** (Gemma 3's vision encoder, ~0.42B) stay in `totalParams` and are excluded
    per token. The tensor classifier tests non-language prefixes _first_, against the name with a
    leading `model.` stripped — newer transformers exports nest the tower as
    `model.vision_tower.*`, which the `model.` language prefix would otherwise swallow silently.

- **Prefill additionally excludes the output projection.** Logits are computed for the positions
  that need them — one — not every prompt token. Charging it per token overstated gpt-oss-20b
  prefill 16%.
- **MoE layer selection has two conventions** and transformers implements each with a specific
  phase: DeepSeek `i >= first_k_dense_replace && i % moe_layer_freq == 0`, Qwen
  `(i + 1) % decoder_sparse_step == 0`. Conflating them overcounts by a whole layer whenever the
  layer count isn't a multiple of the step.
- **Gated repos** (`meta-llama/*`, `google/gemma-*`) return 401 unauthenticated, so those seeds
  point at open mirrors. `HF_TOKEN` allows the originals.

## Open questions

Correctness follow-ups live in
[the repository's open issues](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues). This section is for the
questions those issues cannot settle, and the three tables below are the record of the fourteen
findings filed rather than patched — six out of the July sweep, all now closed; six out of the v2
pass, of which #165, #166, #170, #171 and #172 are now closed too, and #174 closed as a record
rather than as work; and two more out of _documenting_ the v2 pass, which is its own entry. Two of
those last eight are open. #182, which #165 split off rather than fold in, is fixed — see the entry
below.
They are kept because what a finding turns out to need is repeatedly not what the issue said it
would be.

The pointer names the open issues rather than a range on purpose. It read "#12–#20" while six newer
correctness issues sat in the table underneath it, so a maintainer following the sentence walked past
exactly the deferred work this section exists to preserve — and the same sentence called #13, #14,
#15 and #19 open when the Status section four hundred lines up records all four as fixed. A range
goes stale in both directions and silently in both.

### The six filed out of the July 2026 sweep, and what settled all six

Six findings were triaged, replied to and filed rather than patched, under the merge rule recorded
above. Each was real, each touched something shared enough that fixing it inside another PR would
have been the third patch at one root cause, and each issue carried its numbers so they were not
re-derived. **All six are fixed**, the last of them on 1 August 2026. What each one turned out to
need is the part worth keeping, because in four of the six the filed framing was not quite the fix:

| filed                                                                                                  | what it needed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [#90](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/90) cpu-ram compute basis, catalogued/peak 0.41–1.12 | **Fixed.** The theoretical vector peak, since `computeEfficiency` already owns the discount — the same #51 rule on the compute axis, and the five rows were being discounted twice. The open question resolved against the wider figure: llama.cpp accumulates in fp32 lanes, so AVX512-FP16 is not the rate. Decode is bandwidth-only, so the EPYC anchor is untouched at 5.94 tok/s; prefill moves up to 2.5×. |
| [#96](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/96) serving graded at the slider's concurrency       | **Fixed**, and the ungraded state went with it: once each tier is graded at its own user count the question is always asked, so `Fitness` has three arms. The narrow capacity symptom was the least of it — the sentence quoting `runnableContextTokens` at the reader's concurrency disproved its own verdict on the two rigs the issue named.                                                                  |
| [#97](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/97) TTFT ramp collapses                              | **Fixed.** 29 of 46 → 4,5,6,7,12,9,3 on the Envelope; 1,025 of 1,269 → 29,57,86,263,323,304,207 on the Matrix. The domain's floor was half of it: a zero anchor is right only where zero is a reading, and no cell answers in zero seconds. Mirroring the _placement_ rather than the ramp index was off by one bucket at every boundary.                                                                        |
| [#101](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/101) the unit suite                                 | **Fixed** by rendering fewer cells: 155s → 24s locally, and CI's build job 7m9s → 1m38s. The property the issue asked for is asserted rather than hoped for — `App.test.tsx` renders a fixed twelve cells whatever the catalog does next. The timeout stayed at 30s deliberately, with the runner ratio written down.                                                                                            |
| [#102](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/102) readout on touch, and at 200%                  | **Fixed.** The issue's cheapest option does not exist — this panel has no table behind a disclosure, it _is_ the table. Two taps instead, keyed on whether the reader has been shown the figures rather than on a pointer type, which a contact-only stylus breaks. 280px against 160px reserved at 320px/200%, fixed by dropping the model from the narrow form and keeping the machine.                        |
| [#103](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/103) `NOT_SEEDED` never revalidated                 | **Fixed** with the issue's own first step — an expiry, plus the structured reason it said to think about first. Three rounds went on one mistake: claiming a mechanical check made a cause exempt from the calendar. It never does. Every cause has a window now, and the checks are what make the windows long.                                                                                                 |

**The shape of that is the thing to keep, more than any of the six.** In four, the filed framing was
a correct description of the symptom and the wrong description of the fix — the cheapest option
rested on a panel that does not exist, the "narrow patch" was the smallest of three defects at one
root, the ramp's direction was half the problem and its floor the other half, and a written policy
needed the structure the issue named as an afterthought. Filing them with their measurements is what
made that visible; the measurements survived and the framings mostly did not.

### The six filed out of the v2 pass, 1 August 2026

Same rule, same shape, and **all six are now resolved, but one of them was never work.** #165 is
fixed, and split in two on the way; #166 is fixed, and the capability gap it recorded turned out to
be llama.cpp's rather than Headroom's; #170 is fixed, and moved the seam it was filed about; #171 is
fixed, and its two halves were answered in opposite directions; #172 is fixed, and two thirds of it
were already closed by #170 before anyone looked — verified against `main` rather than taken on
report. #174 is **closed as answered rather than fixed**, being the written argument for a decision
already taken, which is why the counts elsewhere in this file never counted it against v3.

This paragraph used to say the opposite — that closing it would lose the reasoning, so it should stay
open as a record. Chris closed it on 3 August 2026, and the objection does not survive contact: the
argument lives here, in the entry below and in the two paragraphs above about `readSignals`, and a
closed issue stays readable. An open issue that is not a task is a worse record than a closed one
next to the reasoning, because every later count has to remember to except it — as the sentence at
the top of this file had to.

| [#165](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/165) resident layers charge the non-layer tensors | **Fixed**, and it turned out to be two issues rather than one — see below. The count divides `layerWeightBytes`; every byte figure is bit-identical to before it; `-ngl` drops on 7.9% of the catalog's configurations, by a median of 1 layer and never rises. The byte assignment those tensors get is [#182](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/182), fixed                                       |
| [#166](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/166) the assignment discards _which_ layers       | **Fixed**, and its second half was answered rather than built. `DeviceShare.layerIndices` records which layers a card holds; the flag the issue hoped for does not exist, because `-ot` overrides where a _weight_ lives while a layer's cache follows the `-ngl`/`-ts` split — see above. The panel states the packing instead: `2,2,2,21,21` layers against `2,2,2,1,1` full-attention ones                 |
| [#170](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/170) tiers graded at scenarios never planned      | **Fixed**, and the seam moved rather than the arithmetic. `gradedScenarios` states the tier structure and the sweep walks it, largest first, stopping at the first scenario the machine can plan — 269 long-context rows across the 43 shipped devices are now graded at the reduced tier, 161 of them `tight`, and no row that already had an answer changed it                                              |
| [#172](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/172) the caveat describes the wrong tier          | **Fixed**, and two of its three findings were already closed by #170 — verified rather than assumed, then pinned by tests that did not exist. The third is the axis `gradedScenarios` deliberately does not express: `declaredConcurrency` states serving's four users and two, and the footer names those rather than the reader's own                                                                       |
| [#171](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/171) the Ollama block and the daemon              | **Fixed**, and the two halves went opposite ways. The block emits no `ollama serve` at all now, and the cache precision is stated as a requirement the reader's own daemon has to meet; concurrency is a refusal, since `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` is a daemon setting and `llama-server` takes the same quantity as `-np N` on the one command                                                                    |
| [#174](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/174) one adapter on a dual-GPU machine            | **Closed as answered**, not fixed. Preferring the discrete card is the answer for a tool that prices inference, not half of "combine both preferences" — and combining would widen the shortlist to two vendors with no ranking rule between them. The third state it floats — _"your browser reports two GPUs; which one do you want to price?"_ — stays unbuilt for want of a count of how often it matters |

**The six group into three pairs, which is the useful way to read them.** Two are the engine
exporting a layer _count_ where what matters is which layers and what is in them (#165, #166). Two
are one root stated twice — the sweep plans one scenario per candidate while the verdict layer
models a tier structure (#170, #172). And two are decisions rather than defects: how far a
copy-pasteable block should go in managing a daemon, and whether detection should ever widen.

**The first two pairs want fixing as pairs**, which is why neither was patched inside a feature
branch: the first meets at `layerSplitBins`, where a per-layer figure that is not per-layer feeds
both a count and a command; the second meets at the seam between `recommend` and `judgeWorkloads`,
and moving that seam inside a PR about a panel is how a root cause gets its third patch. **The third
pair is a pair only in this table** — a daemon's lifecycle and a dual-GPU policy share nothing but
the sentence they are listed in, #174 is already answered rather than open work, and coupling them
would be the same over-generalisation this file keeps warning about, arriving in the paragraph that
warns about it. (Caught by Codex on #175.) **And the daemon half then answered itself in two
directions**, which is the last of the pairing arguments to come apart: one issue, one file, and a
note on one half against a refusal on the other. See **Launch commands**, above.

**The first of those pairs then did not need fixing as a pair, and #165 split in half instead.** The
half that shipped is the one its own verification note demanded, and it touched `layerSplitBins`
without touching what #166 is about — so the pairing was right about where the two meet and wrong
about what that implies for sequencing. The issue asked for two things that turn out to be
incompatible: charge the fixed
tensors to the bin that holds them, _and_ do not move the busiest bin's byte totals. They cannot
both hold — an indivisible block cannot balance as finely as `1/L` of it can — and the second is the
load-bearing one, because the bins' bytes are the input to every memory panel, `fits`, `impossible`
and both speed estimators. So the count's basis was fixed and the byte assignment was left alone,
which is exactly the scope the issue's title states.

**And #166 did not need the pair either**, which retires the pairing rather than deferring it. Its
fix records `layerIndices` beside the counts `layerSplitBins` was already tracking, moves no byte and
changes no packing — so what looked like one root at `layerSplitBins` was two _recordings_ at one
site. The site was shared and the fixes were not, and that is the second time in this table that a
correctly identified meeting point implied nothing about how the work divides.

The measurement is what decided it rather than the argument. Assigning the block to one bin moves
`usedBytesPerDevice` by more than 5% on 10.2% of the catalog's multi-card layer-split configurations,
by up to 27.9%, and flips `fits` on 0.60% of them and `impossible` on 0.12% — a change to what the
product answers, wearing a layer count's clothes. What shipped instead is bit-identical on 2.4M
sampled byte figures and changes `-ngl` on 7.9% of configurations, **every one of them downward**, by
a median of 1 layer and at most 8. The remainder was [#182](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/182).

**#182 is fixed, and the sentence that stood here — that it was "blocked on reading
`llama-model.cpp` rather than on the arithmetic" — was true when it was written and stale the moment
the source was read.** It was left standing through three PRs afterwards, which is the failure this
file exists to prevent: a blocker recorded without the thing that would clear it is a note that goes
stale silently. What the reading settled, at ggml-org/llama.cpp commit `360e134`:

- **`token_embd.weight` is on the host, unconditionally.** `llama-model.cpp:1333-1335` — _"there is
  very little benefit to offloading the input layer, so always keep it on the CPU"_ — with no
  `-ngl`, `-sm` or `-ts` input to the decision.
- **A tied model materialises the table twice**, so the two beliefs the issue posed as alternatives
  both hold. `TENSOR_DUPLICATED` re-routes the output's creation to `buft_list_output` and the
  de-dup at `llama-model-loader.cpp:1285-1300` only fires when the same buffer type already holds
  the tensor — CPU input buft against a last-GPU output buft, so a second tensor is created and
  llama.cpp adds its bytes to `size_data` itself. Measured on `gemma-3-270m-GGUF`: a 271.81 MiB file
  resident as 170.00 MiB on the CPU and 271.81 MiB on MTL0.
- **So the consequence inverts the issue's framing.** For a **tied** model the rig total was already
  right and only the distribution was wrong — which is Gemma 3 4B, the row the issue nominated as
  mattering most and the one that moves least. For an **untied** model the cards were being charged
  a whole extra table: 7.6% of the file on Qwen3 8B, 6.5% on Llama 3.1 8B, and 26 of the 35 catalog
  rows are untied.
- **`fixedBytes` is the wrong unit**, because the three tensors have three placements: the input
  embedding on the host, the output projection on the **last** `-ts` device, a vision tower on the
  **first** GPU via `clip.cpp`'s own backend list. Lumping them and seeding one bin would have put
  the input embedding on a card that never holds it and the tower on the card holding the output.
- **It is `discrete-gpu`-only, and only for a runtime that declares the residency.** With mmap the
  host tensors are wrapped from the mapping and Metal declares `buffer_from_host_ptr = true`, so
  unified memory pays once however llama.cpp labels the buffer; and vLLM shards the embedding table
  across tensor-parallel ranks and keeps every shard on a GPU, so the correction is llama.cpp's
  placement rather than a universal one. The second gate read `parallelism === 'layer'` until #209,
  which is a proxy and not the fact: `RuntimeSpec.parallelism` states how layers and their caches
  _shard_, never where a tensor no layer holds ends up. It picked out llama.cpp alone only by
  accident of the catalog — MLX is layer-parallel too and is saved by never meeting `discrete-gpu` —
  so a layer-parallel row added for discrete GPUs would have taken a whole `vocab x hidden` table off
  its card budget silently. `RuntimeSpec.hostResidentInputEmbedding` is the fact, and it is required
  rather than optional for the same reason `ModelSpec.tiedEmbeddings` was made required on the same
  PR — a boolean read as `false` by omission is safe only while the polarity happens to point that
  way. It decides the input embedding alone: the output projection and any tower are placed by the
  split, not by the runtime.

Two things found on the way there are worth keeping even though neither is #165. **`weightBytesPerDevice`
is unstable by construction on hybrid models**: it is the busiest-by-_combined_-load bin's weights,
and Gemma 3 12B on three 4090s at 128K/8 users puts three bins within 1% of each other on load with
completely different composition — so a 0.9 GB block moves one sliding layer and changes which card
the entire readout describes. That is why most of #182's `weightBytesPerDevice` tail is identity
flipping rather than bytes moving, and why a test resting on which bin is busiest needs a margin
rather than a coin flip. **Two tests turned out to be resting on one**, and both were found by this
change rather than reasoned about: the placement suite's "names the device that made it impossible"
and `App.test.tsx`'s "quotes the card that made it impossible" both sat on a Q4_K_M scenario whose
top two bins were 0.2% apart, and seeding the vision tower onto the first bin swapped them. Both now
run at Q8_0, where the margin is 24.95 GiB of floor against an 18.57 GiB readout. And **the fixed
tensors are a large fraction of exactly the small models**: 25.4% of Gemma 3 4B, 21.4% of Ministral
3 3B, 15.2% of Qwen3 8B, 12.3% of Llama 3.2 3B — so "the vocabulary is a rounding error" is true for
the models nobody has trouble running and false for the ones people run on the hardware they already
own.

**The second pair did meet where the table said it does, and #170 is the half that moved the seam.**
`gradedScenarios` states the tier structure — a `(prompt, window)` for each tier, largest first — and
`recommend` walks it, stopping at the first scenario the machine can plan. That is the option the
issue named as the honest one, and the reason the cheap one was refused is worth keeping: planning
the refusal at the archetype's _smallest_ tier admits candidates whose headline scenario is
impossible, and `judgeWorkloads`' top-level refusal would then have to be re-argued at every call
site. Walking downwards leaves that refusal exactly where it is — it fires when _no_ tier's scenario
loads.

**It is also the one pairing claim in this table that paid**, which is worth noting beside the two
that did not: fixing the root closed two of #172's three findings without either being worked on, and
what was left of the second issue was the third finding plus the tests neither had. The other two
pairs came apart in opposite directions — one issue that split in half, and one that was never a pair
at all — so the lesson is not "pair issues that share a root", it is that the pairing argument has to
name the _seam_ and not the symptom. This one named `recommend`'s seam with `judgeWorkloads`, and
that is where both fixes landed.

**The issue's own premise was false and the issue said so, which is the part worth carrying.** The
finding it was filed from claimed the verdict layer "would grade the configuration `tight`"; it would
not, because `judgeWorkloads` refuses at the top and returns `fail` for all seven, so dropping the
candidate and grading it `fail` are the same answer. The defect was **silence**, not a wrong grade:
the tier that admits the machine never ran, so a reader asking what a 64K-capable card can do for
long context was told nothing rather than "this one, at half the window". A correctness issue can be
about what is not said.

The measurement, over the 43 shipped devices at one card, an fp16 cache and one user: **269
long-context rows are now graded at the reduced tier, 161 of them `tight`.** 208 are pairings that
had no row at all, and the other 61 replace a narrower format that had won its pairing by default —
every one of those 61 a swap to a **wider** format, which is `QUANT_RULE` working rather than a
second effect, since the wider format was being dropped for a scenario the machine could not plan.
**Nothing that already had an answer changed its grade or its sentence**, on any archetype — and the
reason is two reasons rather than one, which is worth stating because the shorter version is false.
For six of the seven the first entry in the list _is_ the declared request, so a machine that can
plan it plans the same window it planned before. The agent's first entry is the 64K session its tiers
endorse, and it is now planned there instead of at its ~16.5K turn; its grade holds still anyway,
because `judgeWorkloads` takes that archetype's capacity from `runnableContextTokens` and its session
from the tier bars rather than from the planned window. What moves on the agent is what the row
_carries_ — the rate, the wait and the spill now come from the session the verdict was already
about, which is the 28 caveats and the nine fallback picks below.

It also retires the stopgap in the middle of [#172](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/172).
The `Math.max` over `WORKLOAD_BARS` that #167 added — the spill fraction read at the archetype's
_widest_ bar — is gone, and the caveat and the decode rate now come from the one scenario the
candidate was graded at. 28 agent rows of 2,533 lose a host-RAM caveat, every one of them a model
whose own window is under the 64K session that widening read: the caveat described a placement the
row was never graded at. Nine agent fallback picks move with the rate, which is that issue's second
finding. What is left of #172 is its third, the serving footer naming the reader's concurrency where
that archetype grades at its own.

**And #172 turned out to be one finding of work, which is only knowable by checking.** The paragraph
above is the claim that #170's fix incidentally closed two of the three, made by the agent that wrote
it and unverified — so both were reconstructed against `main` before anything was written, and the
useful part is that a second-hand "this is already fixed" is exactly the sentence a regression hides
behind. Both hold. **Finding one**: over the 43 shipping devices at one card, an fp16 cache and one
user, all 484 agent rows graded `tight` — 258 at the 32K session, 226 at the 64K one — carry the
spill fraction of the window they were graded at, with no exceptions; on 64 of them the widened
reading the stopgap took is a _different_ number, and on rows like Qwen3 14B at NVFP4 on a 5080 it is
0 against 0.146, which is a host-RAM caveat printed on a configuration that keeps every weight
resident at the session it was recommended for. **Finding two**: all ten agent fallback picks over
those devices carry the rate measured at the scenario they were graded at, and nine of the ten
measure differently at the archetype's turn — 100.0 tok/s against 142.2 on an M4 Max Studio, 6.7
against 11.6 on the 8 GiB fixture the tests use. Neither needed a line of code. Both now have one,
because a finding that is fixed and untested is one commit from reopening, and `recommend.test.ts`
had no case for either.

**The third needed the same seam moved one axis further, and the axis is the interesting part.**
`gradedScenarios` states a working size per tier and deliberately says nothing about users, because
serving's tiers differ in _users_ rather than in window — so `declaredConcurrency` is the companion,
returning serving's four and two in tier order and an empty list for the six archetypes that inherit
the reader's. Empty rather than `[concurrency]`: a caller can then tell "declares its own" from
"happens to be graded at one user" without comparing numbers. `Shortlist` carries the result, and the
footer prints it — the panel never reads `WORKLOAD_BARS`, which is the whole point of the seam.

**What it says is narrower than "the slider stopped mattering", and the narrowness is deliberate.**
The sweep still plans every placement at `RecommendInputs.concurrency`, for serving as for the rest,
so that setting still decides which serving rows load at all and what a row's spill caveat describes
— it is the _grade_ that comes from four users and two. So the footer says which of the two questions
it answers rather than printing one count and letting the reader assume it did both jobs. **This
leaves a real thing unfixed, and it is not one of #172's three**: a serving row's carried figures are
still the reader's-concurrency ones, so at 64 users on a 5090 a row reads 0.61 spilled beside a
sentence grading it `good` on a four-user placement with headroom to spare. That is finding one's
shape on serving's axis, it is not what #172 filed, and fixing it means planning the sweep at the
tier's user count — which moves the load gate and therefore which rows appear, and wants its own
issue and its own measurement rather than a paragraph in this one.

**One residue worth writing down before it is rediscovered as a bug.** On 138 agent rows of 2,465 the
window the sweep plans is not the session `judgeWorkloads` floors at: phi-4's own 16,384-token
ceiling is under the tight tier's 32K session, and some rows can place neither tier's. Every one of
those is `fail` on capacity — a bar read from `runnableContextTokens`, whose sentence quotes no rate
— and none is a fallback pick, so no figure a reader sees comes from the disagreement. It is the same
"a tier is a stated size" argument as the ceiling paragraph below, seen from the verdict layer's end.

**The model's own ceiling is where this got interesting, and it is the thing to re-read before
touching `gradedScenarios`.** A first version clamped every returned window with
`Math.min(model.maxContext, …)` at the call site, which is what the archetype's own scenario has
always done — and on a model capped at 40,960 it turned the agent's 64K session into a 40K one, so
315 agent rows started quoting a session figure the verdict layer had never named and six changed
grade. A tier is a _stated_ size: a model that cannot hold it is not graded at it, and the capacity
bars already read `runnableContextTokens`, which the model caps. The archetype's own request is the
opposite case and its window is truncated as it always was, because that row has to exist to say the
machine cannot do the job — with its _prompt_ truncated alongside it now, which is new and is the one
figure on those rows that moves: a long-context row on a 40K model was being timed reading a 128K
prompt the window cannot hold. Two kinds of entry, two answers to one ceiling — which is why the
ceiling is an argument to `gradedScenarios` rather than a `Math.min` in the caller.

**And the review pattern held exactly as this file predicted.** Codex ran four rounds on some of
these pull requests, and from round three onward the findings were largely defects in the _previous
round's fix_ — a `&&` that cannot chain a heredoc, a `set -e` that would have escaped into the
reader's interactive shell, a two-way ternary that labelled a Q4 format "8-bit". That is the
argument for the merge rule rather than against it, provided the root causes are the ones fixed.

### Two more filed out of documenting it, which is the finding about the documenting

Writing the four sections above took **more than ten review rounds and over twenty findings, none of
them false**, on a pull request that changed one comment and a Markdown file. (The count is stated
as a floor on purpose: every version of this paragraph carrying an exact total was made stale by the
next round, which is its own small lesson about self-referential numbers in a document under
review.)

Most had one shape: **a claim about the code that the code did not support** — an adapter limit
described as narrowing when the feature had withdrawn that prune in review, a `compare` credited
with checking a build commit it never reads, a table called "generated" with no generator in the
repository, a memory reading called a floor when the spec rounds to the nearest power of two. Prose
_about_ code is not checked by the test suite, the build, or the reader, and it is read later by
someone who cannot easily tell it from the code. That is the argument for reviewing a documentation
change exactly as hard as a functional one, and it is why this section exists at all.

**The later rounds taught something the early ones did not, and it is the more useful half.** Once
the false claims were gone, four consecutive rounds each found a _new_ imprecision created by the
previous round's fix, all in one paragraph — a summary of `describeMismatch`. Rewording it again was
never going to converge: a paraphrase of a function with many conditional branches is a second
implementation that no test covers. It is a pointer now, carrying only the one property a reader
cannot infer (a check fires only when the paste states the field), which is what a summary of code
should be whenever the code is the thing that can be read instead.

Two of the findings were not about the prose at all. They are defects the prose walked into:

| [#180](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/180) the emitted decode depth is unusable                       | **P1, fixed 5 August 2026.** `llamaBench()` emitted `-d prompt+prefix`; `Calibrate` expects `contextTokens`; `describeMismatch` rejects a depth off by 10%. The panel's own command produced a row the panel marked unusable. Filed as a question about what `estimateDecode` should charge, on the premise that the expectation was unreachable — but `llama-bench` sizes `n_ctx` from the test, so `-d ctx-n -n n` reaches it exactly. The engine was left alone and the emitter moved; see **Launch commands**         |
| [#181](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/181) markdown loses the cache precision **and the layer count** | **P2, fixed 5 August 2026.** `parseMarkdown` never read the header row. It had no branch for `type_k`/`type_v`, so every markdown paste read as f16 — including the one the panel's own `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -o md` produces with the columns printed — and it found `ngl` by position, which those same columns displace, so the placement check was skipped and an offloaded run compared clean against a resident prediction. One fix for both, and a cache-only fix would have left the worse half; see **Calibrate** |

### Standing questions

- **MLX has no native quantization entries** ([#18](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/18)).
  Other catalogued formats stand in _by width_ — Q4_K_M's 4.85 bpw against MLX's ~4.5, and the
  non-GGUF INT8 at a flat 8.0 — so every figure for an
  Apple-silicon configuration derives from a format MLX does not load. The alternative, BF16 only,
  makes Apple silicon unusable in a tool where it is a headline case, so the
  substitution stays; it is entangled with the `weightFormats` check, whose MLX list includes those
  formats precisely so it keeps working.

  **What changed is that it is no longer invisible.** `substituted.nativeFormats` on the runtime
  names the formats it genuinely loads — everything else in `weightFormats` is a stand-in and is
  marked by default. The polarity is the point, and the reason to state it here: a format added to
  a runtime later is marked until someone says otherwise, where a list of the stand-ins themselves
  would leave that format silently unmarked. The Bench marks every figure derived from one; the
  Matrix marks a grid containing any. That is the rule `devices.json` already followed for
  pre-release specs, applied to the other kind of uncertain input: a documented approximation is a
  modelling choice, and an invisible one is invented data. Note the marker is deliberately narrow —
  BF16 is a real MLX format and carries none, because a warning on the majority case trains people
  to ignore it where it matters. `int8` was on that list and should not have been: MLX's 8-bit is
  affine like its 4-bit, while the catalogued `int8` row is LLM.int8() at a flat 8.0 bpw, aimed at
  vLLM. Leaving it native inverted the two 8-bit stand-ins — the marked `q8_0` at 8.5 reported
  13.7 GiB _heavier_ than the unmarked `int8` on a 235B, which is the asymmetry this exists to
  abolish. Resolving it properly needs a measured MLX width; see #18.

  **What would still resolve it** is measured bits-per-weight for MLX's affine 4- and 8-bit schemes,
  at which point the substitution is deleted rather than explained. That needs real checkpoints on
  Apple hardware; the marker is what makes the interim honest rather than what makes it right.

  **The cache was a second, independent substitution, and it hid behind the first** (#33, closed by
  extending the marker). `kvElementBytes` falls back to the nominal width when a runtime declares no
  `kvBytesPerElement` — exact for a float format, not for an affine one. MLX's `--kv-bits 8` is a
  real flag, so the entry in `kvPrecisions` is not a fiction; what is missing is its _width_, since
  affine quantization carries a scale and a bias per group. The cache is therefore charged exactly
  one byte per element, which understates it — in the direction that reports a long-context
  configuration fitting when it does not, which is the direction this repo cares most about.

  **The axes are independent in both directions**, which is why `substituted` names its cache list
  alongside `nativeFormats` instead of folding them together: MLX at Q4_K_M with an FP16 cache
  substitutes only weights, and MLX at BF16 with an 8-bit cache substitutes only the cache — and
  that second combination **carried no marker at all**, which is worse than the half-described
  state the issue was filed about.

  **Then the width turned out to be derivable, and the marker was the wrong answer** (#38). The
  first pass concluded it needed "a real checkpoint on Apple hardware, which nobody here has" —
  wrong for the same reason the `--default-font-size` claim below was wrong: a negative result
  about a tool, written down without checking the second place. `mlx-lm`'s source states it.
  `QuantizedKVCache(group_size=64, bits=8)`, and `mx.quantize` returns packed data, a scale, **and
  a bias** — the last two at `keys.dtype`:

  ```
  8 + 16/64 + 16/64 = 8.5 bits = 17/16 bytes per element
  ```

  The same kind of derivation as llama.cpp's 34/32: published source, not hardware. It lands on
  exactly llama.cpp's figure by coincidence — one fp16 scale per 32 elements versus a scale _and_ a
  bias per 64 both come to half a bit — and that coincidence has no test, because `17/16 === 34/32`
  at runtime. Do not merge them into a shared constant.

  **The threshold is all-or-nothing, and the first draft of this paragraph got it backwards.**
  `--quantized-kv-start` defaults to 5000 on the CLI, which reads like "the first 5,000 tokens stay
  fp16 and the tail is quantized" — it is not. `to_quantized` quantizes the _whole_ array at once,
  so crossing the threshold converts everything. The figure is therefore **exact above 5,000
  tokens** rather than approximate; below it the cache is entirely fp16 and costs 2 bytes per
  element, so a short-context Apple configuration is under-charged ~1.9x. Not modelled, because the
  error is proportionally largest exactly where the cache is smallest, and every context this tool
  is interesting at is past 5,000. Caught in review — the wrong version was a plausible reading of
  a flag name, asserted without checking the function it names.

  **And resolving it forced the contract question this always carried** (#45). `nativeKvPrecisions`
  asked whether a precision was stored at its _nominal_ width, which was the same question as "is
  it known" only by accident — every non-nominal width in the catalog also happened to be
  unmeasured. MLX's 8.5 bits is not nominal, so under the old predicate it could never be listed,
  and the app would have gone on warning that a derived figure rested on a guess. It is
  `measuredKvPrecisions` now, and the invariant that came with the rename is the part worth
  keeping: **a precision listed as established whose real width is not nominal must also carry that
  width**, or the marker goes quiet while the arithmetic stays wrong — worse than either alone.

  The consequence is that no shipped precision is marked any more, so the mechanism has no live
  trigger. It is not dead — it fires for the next precision added without a width. The polarity
  test drives that with a synthetic runtime, and the two surfaces that render it are held by a
  mocked `kvSubstitutionFor`, because an unreachable branch is one nobody notices breaking.

- ~~Codex connector coverage is unconfirmed.~~ **Confirmed working**, and characterised in
  **The post-release sweep** above, which is the current runbook and supersedes what this entry used
  to say. Two corrections, because the superseded version was actively misleading in both halves:

  - "Reviews arrive roughly 40 minutes after a push, so don't conclude the connector is missing from
    a quiet first half-hour" was patience described as evidence. Every clean verdict in the sweep
    arrived within about two minutes of a nudge, and one push sat 27 hours in silence on a healthy
    connector. **A quiet half-hour is a skipped push, not a queue position** — nudge once.
  - "It signals no findings with a 👍 reaction, so merge-readiness needs the reaction's `created_at`
    to postdate the head commit" was **correct, and this file was wrong to correct it.** The
    replacement — that `+1` also arrives on unreviewed pushes, so a reaction never answers the
    question — treated 👍 and `+1` as two signals when GitHub's reaction content for 👍 _is_ `+1`,
    and it stalled #183 waiting for a comment that never came. Restored as written, and stated in
    full in **The post-release sweep** above. **Ask whether _this head_ was reviewed** remains the
    right question when no reaction is present — against both the reviews API and the issue
    comments, comparing the SHA as a prefix, since the no-findings form abbreviates it to ten
    characters.

- ~~`main` is unprotected.~~ **Enforced since 28 July 2026**, when the repo went public. The
  ruleset requires a pull request, squash merges only, both CI checks green, and every review
  thread resolved; deletion and force-push are blocked, with no bypass actors. What had been
  convention for the whole build is now the rule — including for whoever writes the next commit,
  who can no longer push to `main` even by accident.
- ~~Device specs need a verification pass before publishing.~~ **Done, 28 July 2026.** All 25 rows
  as they then stood — the catalog is 43 rows since #78 — checked against vendor documentation.
  Bandwidth — the number that governs everything — is
  confirmed on every one: the four CPU rows are exact by arithmetic (12 channels × DDR5-4800 × 8
  bytes is 460.8 GB/s to the digit, and the other three likewise), and the rest match their
  datasheets. **One real error, in MI355X:** its whole compute row was the air-cooled MI350X's
  (2300/4600/9200 dense), because the source pointed at the MI350 _family_ page. MI355X is the
  1400W liquid-cooled bin at 2400 MHz — 2500/5000/10000 — and the row now cites the part's own
  page. Same silicon and same memory, so nothing else moved.

  Three conventions worth writing down, since all three look like bugs and are not:

  - **A raiseable allocation ceiling states how far it raises, and it is never physical capacity**
    ([#53](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/53)). `allocatableTunable` and
    `maxAllocatableGiB` only mean anything together, and the pairing went unenforced: every Apple
    row declared the first and omitted the second, so `maxAllocatablePerDevice` fell back to
    capacity and all six claimed 100% of RAM could be wired to the GPU. The app offered the owner
    of a 96 GiB Mac Studio a 95.5 GiB configuration. The trap is that `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` really
    will _accept_ that value — what loads is bounded by what macOS needs to keep running, not by
    what the sysctl parses, and the distance between those two is the whole subject of the field.
    The Apple rows now reserve `max(8 GiB, 1/16 of RAM)` with the reason in each `note`; the
    reserve is a judgement rather than a datasheet figure, which is exactly why it is written down.
    `catalog.ts` refuses a tunable row that states no maximum or states one at capacity, and
    `maxAllocatablePerDevice` reads an absent value as "not raiseable" — under-promising rather
    than over-promising, which is the direction this class of error keeps failing in.
  - **Marketed HBM capacities run ~0.4% above true binary capacity.** H200's "141 GB" is 143,771
    MiB — 140.4 GiB — against a stored `capacityGiB: 141`; H100's "80 GB" is 79.65 GiB against 80.
    It does not reach the engine, because what the engine budgets against is `allocatableGiB`,
    which is below the true figure in every case (139 and 79). The headline stays as vendors quote
    it; the number that decides a fit is conservative.
  - **Bandwidth is theoretical peak, never measured.** Strix Halo's 256 GB/s is AMD's rating and
    real workloads see ~213. That gap belongs to `bandwidthEfficiency` and
    `CLASS_BANDWIDTH_UTILIZATION`, which exist to model it — folding it into the catalog would
    double-count it and quietly break the calibration anchors.

    **This rule was written down here and broken in the same week** ([#51](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/51)).
    The Ryzen row carried `measuredBandwidthGBs: 213` against its 256 rating, and
    `effectiveBandwidth()` preferred it — so the constants discounted an already-discounted
    figure and every Strix Halo throughput number read 16.8% under the treatment the other 24
    devices get, on the one surface whose purpose is ranking hardware against hardware. The field
    and `effectiveBandwidth()` are both gone now rather than deprecated: `types.ts` had a docblock
    arguing _for_ preferring measured, naming Strix Halo as the case for it, which is how a stated
    convention and the catalog came apart without either looking wrong on its own. A field is an
    invitation. `catalog.test.ts` now pins the convention itself rather than the ordering — the old
    check only asserted measured ≤ theoretical, which passes just as happily with the override
    present.

  The `rumored` row (M5 Ultra) is still press-rumour grade and must stay visibly labelled in the UI.

- ~~The catalog was accurate about 25 machines and silent about the ones the audience owns.~~
  **43 rows since [#78](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/78).** Coverage is a different
  property from accuracy and fails where accuracy checks cannot look: a machine that is absent is not
  wrong about anything. Three vendors' consumer lines and the whole sub-$1000 tier were missing — the
  cheapest catalogued GPU was the 5080 at $999, AMD appeared only as datacenter Instinct parts, Intel
  not at all, and every Apple row was a maxed configuration — so most "will it run" questions had no
  row to ask about rather than an incomplete answer. `catalog.test.ts` now asserts the _shape_ of the
  coverage (a sub-$350 GPU, consumer silicon from all three vendors, Intel in both classes it
  competes in, an Apple row at 16 GiB and one back at M1) rather than a list of ids, and one of those
  checks runs the engine: at least one machine under $400 has to genuinely hold a 12B at Q4_K_M and
  decode above 15 tok/s, since coverage by a row that cannot run the model is coverage in name only.
  **`some`, not `every`, and the distinction is the test's whole correctness:** that tier is where the
  next rows will be an 8 GiB 5060 or a 10 GiB Arc B570, which are honest rows that cannot hold a 12B
  at all, so a swept assertion would fail on exactly the coverage work it was written to protect.

  Four things worth keeping, since each was a decision rather than a transcription:

  - **Every vendor states compute in a different unit, so each row's `tflops` is a derivation** and
    the derivation is now written at the top of `devices.json` per vendor. Intel publishes a peak
    INT8 figure and no FP16 one, and XMX runs INT8 at exactly twice FP16 (4096 against 2048 ops per
    Xe-core per clock), so the Arc rows are half the stated TOPS. AMD publishes both an FP16 _matrix_
    and an FP16 _vector_ rate and the two differ by 2x on RDNA 4 — the matrix one is what a tensor
    kernel reaches, and quoting the other would halve prefill on the generation that doubled it.
    NVIDIA's single "AI TOPS" headline is sparse _and_ quoted at the lowest precision the generation
    reaches, so dense fp16 is the headline over 8 on Blackwell (sparse FP4: 3352 → 419 on a 5090) and
    over 4 on Ada (sparse FP8: 1321 → 330 on a 4090) — and the datacenter parts are transcribed, not
    derived, because A100's dense 312 fp16 is 16x its FP32 rather than the 4x that holds on GA10x.
    **The first draft of that paragraph stated all three NVIDIA clauses wrongly** while the rows were
    right, which is the #51 failure again: a curator applying the sentence to the next Blackwell row
    would have entered double the correct fp16, and no test could see it. The check that now exists
    pins the dense _ladder_ inside each row (int8 and fp8 at 2x fp16, fp4 at 4x); the divisor itself
    is only guarded by the worked examples beside it naming the headline they start from.
  - **The Apple allocation rules cross over below 32 GiB.** The default is Metal's recommended
    working set (two thirds of RAM at 32 GiB and below, three quarters above) and the ceiling is
    capacity minus `max(8 GiB, 1/16 of RAM)`, per #53. On a 24 GiB machine both land on 16 GiB, and on
    a 16 GiB machine the reserve would put the ceiling _below_ the default. Six maxed configurations
    all sat far above the crossover, so the rule looked universal. Those rows state no raiseable
    ceiling at all rather than one promising less than the machine already offers — #53's
    under-promising direction, applied at curation time instead of in `maxAllocatablePerDevice`. Both
    rules are swept over every Apple row rather than spot-checked, because the next small Mac added
    will hit the same crossover.
  - **A device id is in other people's links, so renaming a row is a compatibility change.**
    `rtx-a6000-ada` fused two products that both exist (the Ampere RTX A6000 and the Ada RTX 6000
    Ada Generation) while every spec on it was the Ada card's. `url.ts` writes `deviceId` as `d`, and
    the failure without an alias is not a broken link: `coerce` cannot resolve the id, falls back to
    the default device, and shows a stranger a DGX Spark's numbers under the sender's URL. Hence
    `DEVICE_ID_ALIASES` and `canonicalDeviceId`, which the **store** applies before it keeps the
    value — resolving only inside `getDevice` would load the right device while leaving the stale id
    to re-encode into the URL and match no `<option>` in the picker. Two things about it are worth
    the next session's attention. The lookup uses `Object.hasOwn` rather than `?? id`, because the id
    comes from a querystring and `DEVICE_ID_ALIASES['toString']` otherwise resolves up the prototype
    chain to a function. And **`d` is the only one of the four ids in a shared link that has a
    canonicaliser at all**: `url.ts` writes `m`, `q` and `r` too, so renaming a model, quant or
    runtime id degrades in exactly the silent way this entry is about. Latent rather than live —
    nothing in those three catalogs has been renamed — and recorded here so the next rename is not
    where it gets discovered.
  - **The unit suite is 2.5x slower** (45s to ~110s) and nothing is wrong. `App.test.tsx` renders the
    whole page per test and the Matrix is 17 models × 42 shipping devices, so ~700 buttons are built
    per render against the old ~400. It is the cost of the coverage, not a regression to chase.

  Deliberately not done: **GB200 and B300**. The issue lists them as lower priority, and the
  per-GPU dense FP4 figures do not reconcile across NVIDIA's own rack-level claims — a `rumored` row
  is for specs that are uncertain, not for arithmetic the curator cannot close. MI325X went in
  because AMD publishes it as a part.

- **Final subdomain** on zoller.ai. The only thing genuinely left, and it is a naming decision
  rather than work: the site is live at the Pages project URL, and moving it is two repository
  variables — `PAGES_CUSTOM_DOMAIN` to the chosen host and `PAGES_BASE_PATH` back to `/` — plus a
  CNAME record. Both variables have to change together, which is why they are documented as a pair
  above.

## Verification

```
npm test && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run build
npm run test:e2e                # Playwright; builds and serves on 127.0.0.1:4173 itself
npm run catalog -- --dry-run    # re-derive the model catalog without writing
```

The engine's reference tests are the spec. If one fails, the model is wrong — do not widen the
band to make it pass.
