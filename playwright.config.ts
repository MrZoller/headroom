/**
 * Browser-level coverage, for the things jsdom structurally cannot see.
 *
 * The unit suite runs in jsdom, which has no layout engine and no `scrollIntoView` at all. That is
 * not a gap in what the tests happen to assert — it is a gap in what they *can* assert, and it has
 * already shipped one real bug: the Matrix's click-to-scroll was first anchored on a
 * `display: contents` element, which generates no principal box, so `scrollIntoView` returned early
 * and the scroll was a silent no-op in every real browser. jsdom's missing method meant the guarded
 * call passed every test. It was caught in review.
 *
 * So the rule for what belongs here is narrow: a spec earns its place only if jsdom cannot answer
 * the question. Geometry, scrolling, media queries that depend on a real pointer, and canvas
 * actually painting. Everything else stays in Vitest, where it runs in a second.
 *
 * Served from a production build rather than the dev server, because the question these ask is
 * whether the thing users get works — and because Tailwind's generated stylesheet is the subject of
 * half of them.
