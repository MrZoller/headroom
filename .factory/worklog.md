## 2026-08-15 — Issue triage and ad-hoc planning

- Reviewed all eight open GitHub issues against their current comments, the roadmap, and the codebase; all retain actionable work.
- Added T1–T8 under `## Ad-hoc`, ordering the catalog test, generator repair, and workflow verification by dependency.
- Classified design-sensitive placement, calibration, pricing, catalog-correctness, and hydration work as major so their PRs require human review.
- Verification: `gh issue list --limit 100 --state open --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,url`; `gh issue view` for issues #193, #195, #197, #199, #205, #207, #208, and #210; `gh api repos/MrZoller/headroom/actions/permissions/workflow`; targeted source searches.
