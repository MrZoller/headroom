/**
 * Writes the site as real HTML files, one per route, plus the sitemap that advertises them.
 *
 * Runs after both Vite builds and reads their output: `dist/index.html` for the shell — the
 * hashed asset URLs, the meta tags, the whole document — and `dist-ssr/entry-server.js` for the
 * app, which it renders once per route and injects into that shell. Nothing here knows how to
 * render React, where the assets live, or what a page should say; it is I/O, two caps, and one
 * content check, over functions the SSR bundle exports and `src/prerender/` tests.
 *
 * **Why a script rather than a plugin.** Requirement 3 of
 * [#178](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/178) is that the route list derive from the
 * catalog and be cap-checked *before anything is written*. That wants a plain import and a
 * `process.exit(1)`, not a value returned from inside a render — which is what every prerender
 * plugin gives you, and why the only maintained one (`vite-prerender-plugin`) was still the wrong
 * trade for about sixty lines.
 *
 * **Nothing here hardcodes `/headroom/`.** Every emitted path is built from `BASE_PATH`, the same
 * environment variable `deploy.yml` feeds Vite's `base` from, and the SSR bundle was built with
 * the same value — so `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` agrees on both sides of the hydrate. The client's
 * asset URLs are absolute and base-prefixed, which is what makes a page at one level of nesting
 * resolve them identically to one at the root.
