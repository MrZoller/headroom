/**
 * Builds src/data/models.generated.json from Hugging Face.
 *
 * The model landscape moves faster than any training cutoff, so this catalog is *derived*,
 * never typed from memory. Two sources per model, both authoritative:
 *
 *   - `/api/models/{id}?expand[]=safetensors` — exact parameter counts by dtype, summed from
 *     the repo's own safetensors index. Not a rounded marketing figure.
 *   - `/{id}/raw/<sha>/config.json` — the architecture itself: layers, KV heads, head dim,
 *     expert counts, attention window pattern, native quantization. Every fetch after the first
 *     is pinned to the commit that one resolved, so a row cannot straddle a publisher push.
 *
 * Everything the engine needs is computed from those. Where a field can't be determined the
 * script throws rather than guessing: a wrong KV formula silently costs someone a GPU, and a
 * loud failure during a weekly refresh is much cheaper than a plausible wrong number shipped
 * to a page people trust.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run catalog                    # write the catalog; any seed failure blocks the write
 *   npm run catalog -- --dry-run       # fetch and report, write nothing
 *   npm run catalog -- --allow-partial # write even though some seeds failed
 *
 * Set HF_TOKEN to include gated repos (meta-llama in particular returns 401 without one).

/**
 * Models deliberately absent, and the reason each one is.
 *
 * This exists because "why isn't X in the catalog?" has an answer for every X worth asking about,
 * and until now that answer lived in a session transcript. Two jobs:
 *
 *   - It is the written record. Every entry was checked against the live `config.json` on the date
 *     in the {@link SEEDS} comment, and most of them refuse in a guard below — so a reader who
 *     wonders why the most-downloaded model in the world is missing gets the reason rather than an
 *     apparent oversight.
 *   - It suppresses the candidate report. Without it, {@link reportSeedCandidates} would name the
 *     same nine refused families every week, which is exactly how a weekly report stops being read.
 *
 * A repo listed here is a *decision*, not a permanent exclusion: the entries that say "refused"
 * become seedable the day the engine grows the term they need, and the report is what will say so —
 * nothing here is checked for still being true.
 */
/**
 * Repos that were checked and declined, with what would change the answer and when it was last
 * asked ([#103](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/103)).
 *
 * **A written refusal used to be permanent**, and that is the defect this shape exists for.
 * `unseededCandidates` filters out every id in here unconditionally, so a model was invisible to the
 * report the moment somebody explained why it was not seeded — and the models in here are, by
 * construction, the high-download ones the report exists to surface. The reasons expire in two
 * unlike ways and neither had a mechanism: support arrives and the refusal becomes wrong, or the
 * repository changes under the id and the same id has a different answer.
 *
 * So a refusal is structured rather than prose. `cause` says **what would change the answer**, which
 * is the part that decides how it expires:
 *
 *   - `engine` — this architecture is one the derivation cannot price. Expires when the engine gains
 *     a capability, which nothing in this repo can detect from the outside, so these age on the
 *     calendar and the weekly report re-asks them.
 *   - `repo` — the refusal is about what this *repository* publishes rather than what the model is:
 *     an export whose safetensors total counts group scales as parameters. Expires when the org
 *     re-uploads, same id and a different answer, so these age too.
 *   - `catalog` — a seeded row already answers this question, named in `supersededBy`. Nothing about
 *     the repo can change that; only a change *here* can.
 *   - `size` — the model is small enough that every catalogued device holds it comfortably, so every
 *     cell of its row would agree and the placement question has no content. Only a change here can
 *     falsify that either — a smaller device.
 *
 * **The last two do not age, and that is a claim this file now has to earn rather than assert.** The
 * first draft said their assumptions were "visible locally and free to check" and checked neither
 * (found in review), which made them exactly as permanent as the prose refusals the whole change was
 * about. So each carries a mechanically enforced invariant instead of a calendar:
 * `build-catalog.test.ts` asserts every `catalog` refusal names a repo that is still seeded, and
 * that the smallest device in the catalog still holds a 2B model with room to spare. Remove the seed
 * or add a smaller machine and the suite names the refusal that has gone stale — which is a better
 * signal than a date, because it fires on the event rather than six months after it.
 *
 * `checkedAt` is the day the repo was last looked at, and {@link staleRefusals} is what reads it.
 * Set it to the day you check, not the day you edit the line — a re-worded reason is not a re-check.
 *
 * `why` stays prose because its reader is a human deciding whether to overturn the refusal, and no
 * enum is going to carry "31 of 80 blocks have no attention at all". What the structure buys is that
 * the *machine* can now tell an expired refusal from a current one, which prose could not.

 * name that moves and these keys are what the block itself is configured from:

 *     refusing and another silently mis-pricing is why both axes are guarded rather than one.
 *   - `conv_L_cache` — LFM2 again: the short-conv state length, which is a state and not a cache.
 *   - `hybrid_override_pattern` — Nemotron-H's per-layer `M`/`*`/`-` string.
 *   - `mb_per_layer` — Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning (SambaY): Mamba blocks interleaved by index, in a

 * still claiming to be tied.
 *
 * Two things a `reduce` over a possibly-absent shape gets wrong, and the second is why this is a
 * function rather than an expression. `(shape ?? []).reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1)` is **1** for a
 * tensor the header does not carry — a real divergence, since the index and the shard header are
 * written by different tools and need not agree on a name — so a `<= 0` guard cannot fire, and
 * `granite-4.1-8b` would ship 8.79B against a resident 8.38B with `tiedEmbeddings: true` beside it:
 * exactly the row the subtraction exists to correct, silently uncorrected. The identity element of
 * multiplication is the one value that makes "no data" indistinguishable from a plausible answer.
 *
 * And the element count is compared against the embedding table, because a tie is a claim that the
 * two tables *are* one: `[100352, 4096]` against a `[100352, 4096]` embedding. Compared as a product
 * rather than as a shape so a transposed export does not read as a disagreement. Note what this
 * cannot see, since the comment it replaces implied otherwise: a head of identical shape that is
 * genuinely independent — a fine-tune that untied the head without editing `config.json` — is
 * indistinguishable from a duplicate by measurement alone, and the config's own `true` is the only
 * evidence either way. That case is wrong in both directions and no shape check reaches it.
