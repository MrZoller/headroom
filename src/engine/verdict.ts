 *
 * **There was an `unmeasured` arm and it is gone, root cause first**
 * ([#96](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/96)). It was added because `fail` was doing two
 * jobs: multi-user serving at one concurrent user read `○ No` in critical red — the same token as
 * "Will not run" — on a Spark that would serve several users perfectly well, purely because nobody
 * had touched the slider (#75). That diagnosis was right and the fix was one level too shallow. The
 * real defect was that serving alone took its defining parameter from the slider instead of
 * declaring it, so the row was answering "have you configured this yet" where the other six answer
 * "can this machine do the job". Once it is graded at its own four users the question is always
 * asked, the ungraded state has no trigger, and a vocabulary token nothing can emit is a claim the
 * UI makes that is never true.
 *
 * The arm's own history is the argument for removing it rather than keeping it unreachable: it
 * immediately began hiding *proved* failures — 384 of 1,292 drivable combinations miss a tight bar
 * at one user and no number of users recovers them (#94) — which is #75's defect pointing the other
 * way. The invariant worth keeping from all of it: **a row is ungraded only when nothing about it

 *
 * **The caller this exists for is `recommend`, and the defect is that a tier never got to speak.**
 * The sweep plans one placement per candidate at the archetype's own scenario and drops the
 * candidate when that placement is `impossible` — but long-context's `tight` tier is graded at a
 * 65,536-token prompt against its 131,072-token job, deliberately, and the agent's tiers carry 64K
 * and 32K *sessions* against its ~16.5K turn. So a machine holding 64K of cache and not 128K had
 * its long-context candidates dropped before the tier that would have accepted them ever ran, and a
 * reader asking what the machine can do for long context was told nothing rather than "this one, at
 * half the window".
 *
 * That is a *silence* rather than a wrong grade, and the distinction is worth keeping straight: the
 * top-level refusal below returns `fail` for all seven when the selected placement is impossible, so
 * dropping the candidate and grading it `fail` produce the same answer. What neither does is plan
 * the smaller scenario the tier is about.
 *
 * The alternative was to plan the refusal at the archetype's *smallest* tier, which is cheap and
 * wrong in the other direction — it admits candidates whose headline scenario is impossible, and the
 * top-level refusal is then re-argued at every call site. A caller walks this list instead and stops
 * at the first entry that plans, which leaves that refusal exactly as it is: it fires when *no*
 * tier's scenario loads.
 *
 * **A pair rather than a window**, because the two bars that carry a working size mean different
 * things and only this file knows which. A `session` figure is already a whole window —
 * `UsageSpec.contextTokens` counts prompt *and* generation, which is what those figures were
 * derived as — and the turn arriving into it is still the archetype's own, which is why both agent
 * tiers name a 16K prompt. A `prompt` figure is a request, so it needs `RESPONSE_ALLOWANCE` on top
 * of it for the window and is itself the prompt. Handing back only the window would leave a caller
 * to reconstruct the prompt by subtraction, which is the second copy of the tier structure this
 * exists to avoid, and it would put the long-context tight tier's placement at a 128K prompt inside
 * a 64K window — a scenario that contradicts itself.
 *
 * The archetype's own scenario is always in the list, so the five archetypes whose tiers differ only
 * in rate and latency return exactly one entry and a walk over it is what a single evaluation was.
 * Serving's tiers differ in *users* rather than in working size, which this deliberately does not
 * express: that archetype declares its concurrency per tier inside `judgeWorkloads`, and the
 * top-level refusal is documented as deliberately keeping the reader's own configuration
 * authoritative there.
 *
 * **`maxContextTokens` is taken here rather than clamped by the caller, and the two kinds of entry
 * answer it differently.** A caller with a model in hand cannot apply one rule to both without
 * knowing which is which, and applying `Math.min` to all of them *invents a working size no tier
 * states*: a model capped at 40,960 turned the agent's 64K session into a 40K one, and every agent
 * sentence on those rows then quoted a session figure this file had never named. A tier is a stated
 * size — a model that cannot hold it is simply not graded at it, and `judgeWorkloads`' own capacity
 * bars read `runnableContextTokens`, which is already capped by the model. The archetype's own
 * request is the opposite case and is truncated instead, prompt with it: it is the headline job, the
 * row has to exist to say the machine cannot do it, and "the largest version of this job the model
 * can hold" is what that row has always been graded at.

   * Serving, measured at **its own** concurrency rather than the slider's
   * ([#96](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/96)).
   *
   * This was the one archetype taking its defining parameter from outside itself, and the asymmetry
   * produced three defects at one root before it was fixed at the root. At one user the row read
   * `○ No` in critical red with a sentence telling the reader to move a slider (#75). The ungraded
   * state added to fix that then hid *proved* failures — 384 of 1,292 drivable combinations miss a
   * tight bar at one user and no number of users recovers them (#94). And `fits` read a capacity
   * computed at the current concurrency, so a rig with room for one served turn and not two passed
   * it, measured fast, and reported "Not measured" while two users deterministically fails.
   *
   * Every other archetype declares the prompt it sends and is graded at its own scenario whatever
   * the sliders say; a completion popup sends 512 tokens on a machine set to 128K. Concurrency is
   * that same kind of declaration for this one — it *is* the content of "multi-user" — so the tiers
   * are graded at four users and two, exactly as `long-context` is graded at a full window and at
   * the reduced one its tight tier admits. **A tier is graded at the scenario it recommends**, which
   * is this file's oldest rule and the one all three defects were versions of breaking.
   *
   * **One evaluation per tier, and capacity comes out of that same evaluation** — which is this
   * file's oldest rule and the thing the first draft of this fix broke. That draft asked capacity at
   * the archetype's own 2.5K turn and asked rate and latency at `max(slider, 2.5K)` like every other
   * archetype, on the reasoning that each half wanted a different scenario. Two scenarios in one
   * grade is exactly the defect the long-context tiers were fixed for: at a 128K slider on a 5090 the
   * capacity conjunct passed on a 2.5K placement while the rate and the wait came from a 128K one the
   * engine had marked `impossible`, and the row read "Usable, but … the weights are spilling to host
   * RAM" — a sentence about spill, for a placement whose whole meaning is that it cannot spill.
   *
   * So `holds` is the placement the figures beside it came from. The window is
   * `max(slider, needs)`, like every other archetype: the reader's context is part of the question
   * ("can it serve four people with the window I have set"), where the reader's *concurrency* is
   * not, because concurrency is what this archetype declares. `evaluateOnce` memoises on all four
   * inputs, so this is one placement and two estimates per tier — not a second `evaluateConfig`, and
   * no binary search.

 * ~14.5 each and ~58.0 aggregate printed "14" and "58", a product no reader can reproduce (#124).
 * So the aggregate is derived from the per-user figure *as printed*. The never-flatter rule
 * survives the derivation: the engine defines per-user as aggregate ÷ users, so users × the
 * floored per-user figure never exceeds the aggregate it measured.
 *
 * The tenths branch mirrors `fmt` for a per-user rate under 10, which today's good bar (10 tok/s)
 * keeps out of this sentence — kept anyway, so a lowered bar cannot silently turn the fragment
