/**
 * Throughput and latency, as a roofline.
 *
 * Decode is memory-bound: every token re-reads the active weights and the whole KV cache for
 * its sequence, doing about one FLOP per byte. Prefill is compute-bound: the entire prompt
 * goes through the network in parallel. A device can be strong at one and weak at the other —
 * a DGX Spark prefills fast and decodes slowly, a Mac Studio does the reverse — which is
 * precisely what a single "speed" number cannot express.
 *
 * **On accuracy.** This is a roofline, not a simulator. Against the three published anchors in
 * speed.test.ts it reads ~19% over on DGX Spark decode, ~19% over on Spark prefill, and within
 * 1% on EPYC decode. It cannot model scheduler behaviour, per-model kernel quality, or thermal
 * throttling. The app must present these as estimates with a band, never as promises.
 *
 * Those first two used to read ~10% and ~6% *under*, and none of the constants below were
 * touched to move them. What changed is that the per-token parameter basis stopped counting
 * work the hardware does not do — the input embedding table decode never reads, and the output
 * projection prefill computes for one position rather than every prompt token. The old
 * calibration was partly absorbing both, which is why correcting them moved gpt-oss-20b decode
 * by 31% while barely touching DeepSeek on EPYC, whose embedding is 2.5% of its active
 * parameters.
 *
 * The knobs were deliberately left alone rather than re-centred on the Spark points: re-tuning
 * a fudge factor immediately after removing the error it was masking is how the next error gets
 * hidden. The residual is now honest and sits inside the +/-30% band the tests assert.
 *
 * **On the calibration constants.** `bandwidthEfficiency` and `CLASS_BANDWIDTH_UTILIZATION`
 * are two free multiplicative knobs fitted to two data points, and only their *product* is
 * observable. The split between "what the runtime achieves" and "what the memory subsystem
 * allows" is not identifiable from this data — it is a defensible physical story, not a
 * measured decomposition. It becomes a testable claim the first time a second CPU-capable
 * runtime or a second CPU device is added, and should be re-derived then rather than assumed.
