 *
 *   1. **Allocatable is not capacity.** A 128 GB Mac cannot hand 128 GB to a model — macOS
 *      caps GPU-wired memory near 75% of RAM by default. Strix Halo exposes 96 of its 128 GB.
 *      vLLM reserves a fixed fraction up front. Sizing against the number on the box is how
 *      you get a configuration that reports "fits" and then OOMs on load.
 *   2. **Offload is a cliff, not a slope.** When weights spill to host RAM over PCIe, the
 *      spilled fraction reads at a small fraction of device bandwidth. It is the most common
 *      reason a working setup is inexplicably slow, and it should be visible in the output

 * card from another and adding them describes a device that does not exist: on a hybrid model the
 * card carrying the big full-attention caches is precisely the one a balanced scheduler gives
 * *fewer* layers, so the two maxima land on different cards. Summing them reported Gemma 3 27B on
 * four 5090s at 31.7 GiB and spilling, where a joint assignment fits it in 30.8 under a 31 GiB
 * ceiling — the first error tonight in the pessimistic direction, and wrong for the same reason
 * as all the optimistic ones: two numbers combined that were never measured on the same thing.
 *
 * Longest-processing-time again, now on the combined per-layer cost, so the balance being struck
 * is the one that actually matters to whether the rig fits.
 *
 * Every bin is returned rather than only the heaviest. The per-device readout needs the busiest and
 * nothing else, but the spill fraction is a property of the *rig*: under a layer split the devices
 * hold different amounts, so one card can be over its ceiling while the rest of the serial stages
 * stay resident. Returning a single load left `offloadFraction` a per-device number that both speed
 * estimators then charged against the whole model's active weights — every stage billed for host-bus
 * time on an overflow that happened at one of them.
 *
 * **The fixed tensors are seeded onto the devices that hold them, and the walk balances around
 * them** (#182). This used to charge every layer `totalWeightBytes / layers`, smearing the
 * embedding table, the output projection and any vision tower evenly across bins that hold none of
 * them; a layer is now charged `layerBytes / layers`, which is a layer, and the blocks are placed.
 * They go to **two different ends of the rig**, which is why lumping them into one seed would have
 * been wrong in a new way rather than approximately right:
 *
 *   - the **output projection** seeds the **last** bin. `llama-model.cpp:1284-1315` normalises
 *     `tensor_split` into cumulative fractions and indexes the output slot through the same
 *     `upper_bound` the repeating layers use, so it lands on the last device with a share of the
 *     `-ngl` window.
 *   - a **vision tower** seeds the **first** bin. `tools/mtmd/clip.cpp:184-205` builds its own
 *     backend list from the first GPU device and never consults `tensor_split`.
 *   - the **input embedding** is not here at all on a discrete-GPU rig, because it is on the host —
 *     `planPlacement` takes it off the total before this is called. On unified memory the host *is*
 *     the rig, so it arrives as part of the first bin's seed.
 *
 * **The seeded bin is emitted last, and that is an invariant rather than a preference.** llama.cpp
 * puts the output on the last `-ts` device regardless of which bin Headroom nominated, so any other
 * ordering asks for a layout it will not execute. Seeding bin `devices - 1` is what lets `launch.ts`
 * put the output tensor's slot on its last share without re-deriving anything.
 *
 * **The invariant is about the bin, not about its layers.** A seeded bin can spill to zero resident
 * layers and still be the bin that holds the table — it is the first to get there, since
 * `spilledOf` clamps its overflow to a `weightBytes` that carries the output block while
 * `residentLayersOf` divides that overflow by a `layerWeightBytes` that does not. `launch.ts` gives
 * the extra `-ts` slot to the last share unconditionally for exactly that reason; the suppression
 * below is not the guard against it, because it runs before any ceiling is known and it guards
 * *assigned* layers.
 *
 * **A bin that ends up with no layer is suppressed rather than emitted**, by repacking over one
 * fewer device. It is reachable only on a seeded bin — an unseeded one starts at zero load and the
 * walk cannot pass it over while layers remain — and only on a small model over six to eight cards,
 * where the output table outweighs a layer's combined load. The layout is legal and reproducible,
 * and a command saying "buy this eighth card and put nothing on it" still reads as a bug; the true
 * and more useful statement is that the model cannot use every card, which is what a shorter
 * `shares` list says.
 *
 * **`layerWeightBytes` still exists and is still what a layer count divides** (#165), and the two
 * fields now differ by a placed block rather than a smeared share of one — so on every bin but the
 * seeded ones they are equal, and on those the difference is exactly the tensor that is there.

   *
   * **Two gates, and each of them is the difference between a correction and a new defect.**
   *
   *   - **`discrete-gpu` only.** With mmap the host tensors are wrapped from the mapping and Metal
   *     declares `buffer_from_host_ptr = true` (`ggml-metal.cpp:682`), so a unified-memory machine
   *     pays for one copy however llama.cpp labels the buffer; CUDA and Vulkan declare it false
   *     (`ggml-cuda.cu:4711`, `ggml-vulkan.cpp:17693`) and the copy is real. On `unified-soc` and
   *     `cpu-ram` the host *is* the rig and the existing charge is right.
   *   - **Runtimes that declare the residency, only.** This is llama.cpp's placement, not
   *     everyone's: vLLM shards the embedding table across tensor-parallel ranks and keeps every
   *     shard on a GPU, which is the same fact {@link weightShards} now rests on. Applying an
   *     llama.cpp residency rule to vLLM would take 7.6% off an untied model's card budget with
   *     nothing upstream saying so, in the direction that reports a fit and then OOMs.
   *
   *     **Asked of the runtime rather than inferred from `parallelism`** (#209). This read
   *     `parallelism === 'layer'`, which selects llama.cpp alone only by accident of the catalog:
   *     MLX is layer-parallel too and is turned away by the `discrete-gpu` half above, and vLLM is
   *     tensor-parallel. `RuntimeSpec.parallelism` says how layers and their caches shard and
   *     nothing about where a tensor no layer holds ends up — so a layer-parallel row added for
   *     discrete GPUs would have taken this deduction silently. `hostResidentInputEmbedding` states
   *     the fact the comment was already naming.
   *
   * Zero for a tied model in any case, and not because the host holds nothing there — see
   * {@link WeightBreakdown.hostResidentBytes}.
   *
   * **What this cannot see, and what the launch surface has to say out loud instead:** `-sm row`
   * splits the output projection across cards rather than holding it whole on the last one, so the
   * seeded packing below is a `-sm layer` statement; and the residency argument is read off the
   * mmap path, which `--no-mmap` leaves. Both move answers optimistically, so neither can live only

   * and it was backwards. `i_gpu_start = max(n_layer_all + 1 - ngl, 0)` shifts the resident window
   * off the **front** of the stack, and the output tensor is slot `n_layer_all`, where
   * `il - i_gpu_start = ngl - 1 < act_gpu_layers = ngl` for every `ngl >= 1`: the output tensor is
   * resident whenever anything is, and what an `-ngl` short of `layers + 1` sheds is layer 0. Read
   * 5 August 2026 from `src/llama-model.cpp:1318-1343` and `common/fit.cpp:581` at
   * ggml-org/llama.cpp commit `360e134`, and measured: an 18-layer model at `-ngl 1` has the output
   * table on the GPU and nothing else.
   *
   * **The count follows the true rule the count already assumed.** A device
   * over budget keeps its fixed tensors and gives up repeating layers from the front, so every
   * overflowing weight byte really does come out of `layerWeightBytes`; overflow beyond that moves
   * the shed layers' KV to the host rather than the pinned tensors. The generous weight reading is
   * not the other defensible option — it is a placement no `-ngl` expresses. It would let a device
   * report every layer resident, which `launch.ts` turns into `layers + 1`, and any `-ngl` holding
   * all `layers` repeating blocks is at least `layers + 1` and therefore holds the output too. There
   * is no flag for "every layer, output evicted"; asking for one is an OOM on load.
   *
   * Floored for the same reason, and under the true rule the floor is exact rather than merely
   * safe: llama.cpp sheds *whole* layers, so the floored ratio is the count it lands on rather than
   * a cautious rounding-down of one.
   *
   * **What the corrected rule touched was the bytes, and #182 has now moved them**: `token_embd` is
   * off the cards entirely on a discrete-GPU rig, the output projection is on the last bin whole and
   * a tower on the first. This expression is unchanged by that, and deliberately so — it was already
   * reading `layerWeightBytes` rather than `weightBytes`, which is the field that stayed a layer
   * count while the composition of `weightBytes` around it changed.
