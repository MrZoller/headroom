 * lets a label read the field rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * **`low` is a tie in the ordinary case, and a caller reading anything but the ramp value off it is
 * reading an arbitrary cell.** `measureValue('fit')` returns exactly 0 for every offloaded cell by
 * design, so on any grid where something spills — most of them — the low end is a whole population
 * and `low` is whichever member comes first in row-major order. That is safe only because every one
 * of them yields the same *value*, which is what the legend prints; see `rampEnd`, which argues why
 * the fit label is the ramp's figure rather than the worst spiller's sentence.
 *
 * **`domain` replaced a bare `max`, and the floor is the half that changed**
 * ([#97](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/97)). The old field was `high`'s value and the
 * caller floored the ramp at zero, on the argument that this grid runs from a desktop CPU to a B200
 * so its bottom really is near nothing. That argument holds for headroom and for tokens per second
 * and does not survive being pointed at a latency. Zero seconds is not a reading any cell can have,
 * and anchoring a log curve at an unreachable point is what took `placed` down to roughly
 * `t_fastest / t`: a cell ten times slower than the grid's fastest landed on step 0, on a grid whose
 * span is far more than tenfold. **A zero floor anchors the ramp's worst end, and for a
 * lower-is-better measure the worst end is unbounded** — there is nothing to anchor to, so the
 * domain is the grid's own span. Stated here rather than at the call site because the ramp and the
 * legend are two readings of one grid, and deriving the domain twice is how they come to disagree.
