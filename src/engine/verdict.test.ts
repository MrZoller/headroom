 * places, which is the ordinary outcome here: a review names a subset of a class.
 *
 *   - serving graded capacity and decode and never read its own prefill, so a deployment where
 *     every user waits minutes for a first token was reported healthy;
 *   - both agent tiers read a rate measured at the 16K turn while recommending the machine for a
 *     32K or 64K session;
 *   - the RAG sentence printed a machine-wide prompt rate beside the time for one document.
 *
 * These assert the class rather than the three instances, at both ends: a stub that varies with the
 * scenario proves the *right* scenario is the one being read, and the real configurations from the
 * issues prove the arithmetic is worth reading.
