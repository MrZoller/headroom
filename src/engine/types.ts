   * Absent — the default, and every archetype but one — means a standalone prompt: `promptTokens`
   * is the whole working set, which is what a single-shot request sends and what every published
   * anchor measures. Present, it splits the two apart: a coding agent's turn sends ~16K *new*
   * tokens into a session that is already resident, and prefix caching (vLLM's APC, llama.cpp's
   * cache reuse) means it does not pay to read the session again.
   *
   * Opt-in rather than derived from `contextTokens - promptTokens`, because deriving it would
   * change every archetype at once — including the single-prompt scenarios the calibration is
   * pinned to. An archetype that re-reads its history says nothing here and gets the old answer.
   *
   * Note the direction: declaring a prefix makes prefill *slower*, not faster. It buys not
   * re-reading the prefix, and it costs attending against it.
