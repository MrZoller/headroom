/**
 * The question people actually arrive with (#138).
 *
 * Nobody thinks "evaluate this model at Q4_K_M under llama.cpp on an M3 Max". They think *"I want
 * a local coding assistant — what is the best model I can run?"* The engine has been able to answer
 * that from the beginning; no surface asked it. The Matrix holds the answer as 1,470 cells to
 * interpret, and this returns the decision.
 *
 * ## The sweep's axes are the engine's, not the Matrix's
 *
 * The Matrix renders every cell under one globally selected runtime, KV precision and quant
 * substitution, at a hardcoded `deviceCount: 1` — its cells are a *slice* of the space rather than
 * the space. A model categorically refused under the current runtime can run under another, and a
 * different quant changes both fit and rank. So this sweeps **models × runtimes × applicable
 * quants**, and takes KV precision and device count as explicit inputs rather than assuming them.
 *
 * ## Every ranking rule is stated, because otherwise the shortlist is an opinion
 *
 * A ranked list is a recommendation, and a recommendation with an unstated basis is an opinion
 * wearing the chassis of a measurement — the failure this whole codebase is organised against. So
 * the two orderings below are exported as sentences (`RANKING_RULE`, `FALLBACK_RULE`) and rendered
 * beside the shortlist, and the quant policy is stated too (`QUANT_RULE`).
 *
 * **Headroom deliberately knows nothing about which model is *better***, only which runs. The honest
 * within-tier ordering is therefore a capability *proxy*, and parameter count is the defensible one:
 * it is already derived from each repo's safetensors index, where benchmark scores are not in the
 * catalog at all and importing them would be a new curation surface with a freshness problem. That
 * is a real limitation and the sentence says so rather than implying a quality judgement.

 * moves on some of those rows, and in one direction only: `gradedScenarios` clamps it to a window
 * the model has truncated, so a long-context row on a 40K model is no longer timed reading a 128K
 * prompt it has nowhere to put. That changes `ttftSeconds`, which no ordering here reads and no
 * surface prints, and nothing else. **The agent is the one whose window moves**, and it moves by
 * design: its first entry is the 64K session its tiers
 * endorse rather than its ~16.5K turn, so the placement now describes the session the verdict is
 * about. Its *grade* does not move with it — `judgeWorkloads` takes that archetype's capacity from
 * `runnableContextTokens` and its session from the tier bars, so it was already grading at 64K while
 * the row's own figures came from the turn. What changes is that the two now agree.
 *

 * the `usage` `judgeWorkloads` grades against, the figures the row carries, and the placement the

 * open — which no scenario rescues, since it is a property of the model, the format and the runtime
