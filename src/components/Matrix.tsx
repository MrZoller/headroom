/**
 * What separates one class band of columns from the next: two spacing steps of the panel's own

 *
 * **A gap rather than a rule, because the grid's existing separator between squares is already a
 * gap.** The table is `border-separate` with `border-spacing-0.5`, so every square is bounded by half
 * a spacing step of surface — the `dataviz` guidance's "2px surface gap between fills" — and a band
 * boundary is that same channel, five times wider: `2 × --spacing` on top of the `0.5 × --spacing`
 * gutter. Ink was the alternative and it has nowhere to come from:
 * `tokens.ts` records `--color-border` at 1.18:1 on this fill, which is why it is the panel edge and
 * not a control boundary, and anything strong enough to read here would compete with the two borders
 * a cell already uses to mean something (dashed for "does not fit", warning for "past the default
 * allocation").
 *
 * **A border rather than padding, and that is geometry rather than taste.** The rotated column label
 * is absolutely positioned at `right-1/2` of its `th`, which resolves against the *padding* box —
 * padding would shift the label off the centre of the square it names, a border does not. The column
 * is widened by exactly the gap (`w-7` → `w-9`, and the coarse-pointer `w-11` → `w-13`) so the square
 * inside keeps its width and its 44px touch target: the gap is added to the column, not taken out of
 * the cell.
 *
 * **`calc(var(--spacing) * 2)` rather than `8px`, and that is the whole of what "exactly the gap"
 * means.** Every length this is compensated against is a multiple of `--spacing`, which is `0.25rem`:
 * `.w-9{width:calc(var(--spacing) * 9)}` against `.w-7{width:calc(var(--spacing) * 7)}` is a
 * difference of two steps, and `border-spacing-0.5` is half a step. Written as `8px` the arithmetic
 * held at a 16px root and nowhere else — at 200% text the column grew by 16px while the border stayed
 * at 8, so two of the 42 squares painted 8px (14%) wider than every other square, and the boundary
 * gutter fell from 5x an ordinary one to 3x. That is #44 exactly ("a length measured from text belongs
 * in the same units as the text"), one token away from the `marks.lineWidth` lesson in `BudgetBar`:
 * two literals for one quantity, here across a *unit* boundary rather than across a file. In the
 * spacing unit the identity `w-7 + gap = w-9` is true at every root, and
 * `e2e/catalog-order.spec.ts` measures it at 16px and at 32px for that reason.
 *
 * Two boundaries at 8px is 16px on a grid whose columns already reach ~1405px, which is the other
 * reason it is spent this way. #64 and #34 are both this header overflowing, so a separator that
 * reserved space per column, or leaned on free space that does not exist, would reopen them; this is
 * the whole cost, it is in flow, and `e2e/catalog-order.spec.ts` measures it at 320px.
 *
 * `data-band-start` carries no style and exists so a spec can find these columns without naming the
 * utility that draws them — the e2e locators named that border class, so the unit fix above would have

   * drawn exactly like a cell that *was* measured and did not fit: `transparent` behind a dashed
   * border, keyed "will not run". A uniformly empty column is the pattern that reads as a confident
   * result, so the picture said "this hardware cannot hold the model" where the truth is "this
   * software does not run here" — and the two need opposite advice. A 256 GB Mac Studio holds
   * Qwen3 8B many times over; the fix a reader would derive from the old picture (buy more memory)
   * is not the fix (change runtime). Every other surface already split them: the Envelope has a
   * separate `unsupported` state with its own sentence, Telemetry says `Unsupported` rather than
   * `Will not run`, and BudgetBar refuses to draw a stack at all. This was the one that collapsed
   * them, on the surface people read as a shortlist (#72).
   *
   * **From `runtimeDrives`, not from "every cell in this column is empty".** At #72's own URL the
   * two happen to agree — the columns with no runnable cell there are exactly these 10, while the
   * DGX Spark still runs a good share of its rows — and that coincidence is precisely what makes
   * deriving the mark from emptiness look safe. It is one slider from wrong. Take that same vLLM
   * grid to 32 concurrent users and the RTX 3090, 4090 and 5080 columns empty out as well, every
   * cell in them refused on counted bytes, and vLLM drives all three fine. Striking those headings
   * would be exactly the misattribution being fixed, only pointed the other way. Model-independent
   * by construction, which is why it is a set of device ids rather than a scan of the grid: "at any
   * size" is the claim, and it is true of the column before any row is scored.
   *
   * **What agrees with what, and what does not.** `planPlacement` turns a cell away on five
   * categorical grounds, and only two of them are facts about a *column*: this one, and "this device
   * has no interconnect, so a model cannot be split across N of them". The other three — a cache
   * precision the runtime cannot store, a weight format it cannot load, a format needing silicon the
   * device lacks — vary with the scenario or with the row, so a column heading is the wrong place to
   * state them. The second column-wide ground is unreachable from here because this grid scores
   * every cell at one device (said in the header above), which leaves this the only reason a column
   * can close today. So the cells' ink and the heading's mark are deliberately *not* the same
   * predicate: the ink asks `evaluated` — was this judged on its numbers — which is the broader
   * question, and the heading asks the narrower one it has wording for.
   *
   * `App.test.tsx` pins the gap shut rather than trusting it, and pins it as an exhaustive claim
   * rather than an example: no cell anywhere may be refused before the arithmetic unless its column
   * is struck. The day a device count is threaded through here, or a runtime is handed a format the

   *
   * The gap #71 left: on a touch-only device the only gesture a cell offers is a tap, and that tap
   * *is* `onClick` — five store keys rewritten and a scroll several sections away. So the readout
   * either filled while navigation was already happening or never filled at all, and a touch reader

   * and unlike the Envelope and the budget bar this panel has no table behind a disclosure to fall
   * back to — it *is* the table, and its cells show colour.
   *
   * **The rule is a state, not a gesture: you may commit to a cell whose figures you have already
   * been shown.** Three drafts got here, and the two it replaced are worth keeping because each was
   * a plausible thing to key on and each was wrong for its own reason.
   *
   * Keying on `pointerType === 'touch'` was the first. It reads as the `any-pointer` lesson (#43)
   * pointed the useful way — the event says what happened, where a media query only says what the
   * device has — and it assumes `pen` hovers. Direct-contact styluses do not, so a pen tap fell
   * straight through to activation exactly as the unfixed touch path did.
   *
   * Comparing against the *live* readout target was the second, and a browser makes that comparison
   * always true: tapping a button focuses it, `onFocus` runs before `click`, so by the time the
   * handler is reached the readout is already this cell's. The guard never fired.
   *
   * Asking at `pointerdown` answers both. It lands before focus moves, so the answer is about what
   * the reader was looking at when they reached for the cell — and every input then falls out of one
   * question rather than a list of pointer types. A mouse hovers, so one click commits. A hovering
   * pen is a mouse. A finger and a contact-only pen are not, so the first tap inspects and the second
   * commits. The keyboard has no `pointerdown` at all, which is the `null` case and always commits —
   * focus has already filled the line, and Enter on a focused cell is not a gesture that could have
   * meant anything else.
   *
   * The question is asked of {@link pointerOver} as well as of the readout state, because a mouse
   * that arrives and clicks within one frame has fired `mouseenter` and not yet been rendered.
   *
   * **Consumed on every click**, which is the other half of the keyboard case: the ref would
   * otherwise still hold the last tap's snapshot, so Enter after a tap would be read as that tap
   * still in progress and refuse to activate — for ever, since nothing else would clear it.

   * target turned an ordinary mouse click into two, which two browser specs caught immediately.
   *
   * **Written only when the pointer entered without being pressed, which is what "hovered" means.**
   * Three rounds of review went into that clause, each one narrowing where the provenance question
   * gets asked, and the answer is: at the moment the record is written, never inferred afterwards.
   * Keying on the *reading* gesture's `pointerType` was the last wrong version — it takes a
   * contact-only stylus for a mouse, because the browser emits a compatibility enter as the pen
   * touches down and that record then exists before `pointerdown` runs. `buttons` is the thing that
   * actually differs: a mouse and a hovering pen arrive with none pressed, a finger and a
   * contact-only pen arrive already in contact. So the record means "this pointer has been shown the
   * figures", which is the rule, rather than "a pointer of a kind that usually can".
   *
   * **And it names the pointer, because on a hybrid there is more than one** (found in review). A
   * mouse hovers cell A, the keyboard moves the readout to B, and a finger then lands on A: without

  /**
   * The reserved line under the grid, and the two pieces of state that fill it.
   *
   * Every figure this grid computes used to be reachable only through a native `title` — a mouse,
   * about a second of dwell, one cell at a time, and gone the moment the pointer moves (#71). That
   * leaves three readers with the colour and nothing else. A sighted keyboard user arrowing a row
   * sees the ring move and no numbers, because the sentence is in the accessible name and they are
   * not listening to it. Touch has no hover at all, so the only way to read a cell is to *commit* to
   * it — `onClick` rewrites five store keys and scrolls several sections away. And anyone comparing
   * two cells gets one tooltip at a time, on dwell, dismissed by the move to the second one.
   *
   * It costs the grid more than it would cost another chart, because `fill` log-scales onto seven
   * steps deliberately — the ranges span orders of magnitude — so the colour is explicitly a rank
   * and not a magnitude. Ranks without a readout answer "which is better" and never "by how much",
   * which is the question a shortlist is for.
   *
   * `BudgetBar` already solved this shape: a reserved line that fills on `onMouseEnter` **and**
   * `onFocus`. The focus half is what fixes the keyboard, and it is free once the hover half exists.
   *
   * **Below the grid, not above it.** A line that grows where it can move the cells is a hover trap:
   * the square under the pointer shifts as the line fills, so the readout describes a cell the
   * pointer has left. Under the grid, the only thing a filling line can push is the legend.
   *
   * **Two states, and whichever input moved last wins.** One `hovered` flag would blank the line on
   * `mouseleave` while the focus ring is still sitting on a cell — a mark and its readout
   * disagreeing, which is the failure `isCurrent` above exists to prevent in the other direction. So
   * the keyboard's cell is what the line falls back to when the pointer leaves: the ring is still
   * visible, so its sentence should still be there.
   *
   * **`hovered ?? focused` on its own is that same disagreement pointed the other way**, and this
   * shipped with it. A pointer resting anywhere on the grid fires `mouseenter` and — because the
   * mouse never moves — never fires `mouseleave`, so its cell outranked the keyboard *indefinitely*:
   * a reader tabbing in and arrowing across a row moved the ring while the line went on printing a
   * different model on a different machine, for every keystroke. Cells carry no `hover:` style, so
   * the ring is the only mark on screen, and #71's first named reader — the sighted keyboard user —
   * got a *wrong* figure where before they got none. A cell's `onFocus` therefore drops the
   * pointer's claim, which makes the rule "the input that moved last", with hover free to take the
   * line back on its next `mouseenter`. `BudgetBar`'s single-state hint cannot have this, because
   * one state means last-event-wins by construction.
   *
   * The response to a hover is this line rather than a mark on the cell, deliberately. Anything
   * drawn on a square inherits the two-tone contrast obligation the selection ring carries — the
   * accent measures 1.06:1 on one step of this ramp — and a mark would still say nothing to the
   * reader who cannot use a pointer.

   * The header: its labels, and the space the rotation needs for them in *both* axes.
   *
   * One object, computed once, because the bug this replaces was two derivations of one quantity.
   * A 45-degree rotation costs `sin(45) × label` of height and `cos(45) × label` of width, and
   * those are the same number — but only the height was ever reserved. So the band was 246px tall
   * at every viewport while the four longest names leaned up-and-*right* past the last column, out
   * of the `overflow-x-auto` container: a grid that fits its panel exactly at 1440 and 1024 got
   * 142px of overflow and a scrollbar anyway, and the default view hid the names the 246px was
   * calculated from. The app paid a phone screen of vertical space for labels it then cut off (#64).
   *
   * The two lengths are the same number and are now written once. Which direction the width is spent
   * in is the other half of the repair, and it is argued under **Lean** below.
   *
   * **Height.** A fixed 96px was set for the names that existed then and is short for several
   * shipping ones — the catalog reaches 40 characters. The table sits in an `overflow-x-auto`
   * container, which clips vertically rather than scrolling, and the Mac Studio variants differ
   * only in the trailing capacity suffix that got cut, so two columns became indistinguishable —
   * the exact failure the rotation was introduced to fix.
   *
   * 8px per character is an estimate rather than a measurement, and the point of the estimate is
   * that it errs *long*: the cost of erring is whitespace, where the cost of erring short is a
   * header clipped by the `overflow-x-auto` container, which clips vertically rather than
   * scrolling. The first version claimed to err long at 6.5 and did not — the app's font stack
   * renders the widest catalogued label at **7.03px per character**, so the constant was 8% short
   * and the `+20` was absorbing all of it, leaving 1.08px of clearance on a 204px row.
   *
   * That was invisible until `e2e/matrix-header.spec.ts` measured it, and it was not merely tight:
   * `--font-sans` resolves to `system-ui`, which is SF on macOS and whatever fontconfig picks on a
   * CI runner. A metrics difference of 1% either way decided whether the header clipped. The spec
   * now asserts the clearance directly, so this constant cannot quietly go short again.
   *
   * **The result is in `rem`, and that is the second time this number has been wrong for the same
   * reason.** The labels are `text-xs`, so their width scales with the root font size — while a
   * height in CSS pixels does not. At a 32px root the text doubled and the row it has to fit in
   * did not, so the container clipped the names again: the exact failure the rotation exists to
   * prevent, reintroduced at the one setting a low-vision reader would be using. 0.5rem per
   * character is 8px at the default root, so nothing moves there. Raised by Codex on PR #36 (#44).
   *
   * **Lean** is the same length, spent sideways — and the labels are turned to spend it *leftward*,
   * over the model-name column, which is the half of this that had to be got right.
   *
   * A trailing lane on the right cannot be made to work, and both versions were built and measured.
   * As `padding-right` it is non-negotiable, so at 1024px — the grid's own min-content is 857px
   * inside a 934px panel — it forces 65px of scrolling onto a grid that fits. As a yielding grid
   * track, `minmax(0, lean)`, it takes only the free space that happens to exist: fine at 1440 and
   * 1280, and between a 857px grid and its 920px painted extent there is *less free space than the
   * labels need*. Measured at 960px of viewport: container 870px, grid 857px — it fits — scrollWidth
   * 920px anyway, with "Threadripper PRO 7995WX" painted 50px outside the visible right edge. That
   * is #64 narrowed to a 60px window of viewport, not repaired.
   *
   * Leaning the other way has no width dependence at all. The space a left-leaning label needs is
   * the model-name column, which is already in flow and already inside the container, and — unlike
   * free space — it is measured from *text*, so it grows with the font exactly as the labels do.
   * The reservation below (`minWidth` on the stub header cell) is what makes that safe rather than
   * lucky: today the longest model name asks for 133px and the lean for 141px, so the guard is worth
   * 8px, and without it a catalog of short model names would lean labels past the container's left
   * edge — where, unlike the right, the overflow is not scrollable and the name is simply gone.

          its focus ring underneath it, invisible at every further ArrowLeft. Scroll padding
          moves the reveal target past the column, and its length is the max of the column's own
          two bounds rather than a copy of either: the `max-w-[9rem]` cap that sizes it today,
          and `headerBand.lean`, the `minWidth` that wins over the cap the day a longer device
          label widens the lean past it (raised in review on #149 — a static 9rem stops short
          exactly then, and a bare lean stops 3px short today). `matrix-grid.spec.ts` measures
          the real geometry, which is what catches a bound this expression does not carry. */}

                      none, and the names are what make the grid readable at all.

                      The full name stays in the `title`, and in every cell's `aria-label` below, so
                      what the shortening drops is one hover or one screen-reader cell away.

                      Anchored bottom-*right* and turned clockwise, so each label ends at its own
                      column and runs up-and-left over the grid it belongs to, rather than starting
                      at its column and running up-and-right past the last one. Geometry, not taste:
                      text that ascends left-to-right has to lean right, and to the right of the last
                      column there is nothing but the edge of the scroll container — which is how a
                      grid that fits its panel came to report 142px of overflow (#64). Leaning the
                      other way spends the same length over the model-name column, which is inside
                      the container and reserved for it above.

                      Struck through where the runtime cannot drive the machine. Dimming was the
                      other half of the suggestion in #72 and there is nothing left to dim with:
                      these labels are already `--color-text-faint`, the faintest ink the palette
                      has, so a second step down would be unreadable rather than recessive. A strike
                      is a non-colour channel in any case, which is what this needs — the cells
                      beneath it carry no ink at all now, and colour alone was never going to be the
                      thing that says why.

                      // `sequential` it measures 2.00, 1.48, 1.06, 1.38, 2.04, 3.07 and 4.52:1, so
                      // an accent-only frame sits below the 3:1 non-text minimum on **304 of the 408
                      // squares the grid held when that was measured** — including the default
                      // selection, on `#3987e5` at 1.38:1, and the grid is 714 squares now. On
                      // `#6da7ec` the two sit 0.022 apart in relative luminance (0.347
                      // against 0.369) and measure 1.06:1 — a pure hue difference, which is #67's
                      // own failure mode restated as a resting state, and gone in greyscale or to a
                      // deuteranope. So the accent band carries a 1px `--color-surface`
                      // separator on its inner edge — the dataviz surface ring, and the same
                      // two-tone trick `Envelope.tsx` uses for its "you are here" mark on the same
                      // ramp ("A ring, not a filled dot: the cell's own colour has to stay readable
                      // underneath it"). The accent is then bounded by surface on both sides — the
                      // 2px `border-spacing` outside, the separator inside — at 7.14:1, and *one of
                      // the two tones* clears 3:1 against every step of the ramp: the separator on
                      // the five light steps (14.26 to 3.50:1), the accent on the two dark ones
                      // where the separator disappears (3.07 and 4.52:1). Worst case 3.07:1, zero
                      // squares below the bar. `tokens.ts` validates the accent against `surface`
                      // and never against the ramp, so a mark drawn on a cell has to bring its own
                      // guarantee; `App.test.tsx` measures it over every fill the grid paints.

                      // The separator rides the `--tw-shadow` slot rather than a second inset ring
                      // because Tailwind composes one box-shadow chain in a fixed order —
                      // `inset-shadow, inset-ring, ring-offset, ring, shadow` — and only the last
                      // slot paints *under* the accent. A 3px inset there shows through in the 2–3px
                      // band the 2px accent does not cover, which is what keeps the accent 2px wide
                      // instead of 1px. (Utility names are spelled out only in the class list below:
                      // Tailwind scans comments too, and a bracketed example in prose compiles to a

          The readout. Reserved at one line so filling it moves nothing, the way `BudgetBar`'s hint
          is — `min-h` on an empty paragraph, rather than a paragraph that appears.

          The reservation is in `rem` and so is the line it reserves for: `min-h-[1.25rem]` is exactly
          `text-sm`'s line height, so the two grow together when the root does. A height in pixels
          under text that scales is the reservation that quietly stops being one, which is the header
          band's #44 all over again in a smaller box.

          `aria-hidden`, and this is the one place this file departs from that pattern. `BudgetBar`
          marks its hint `aria-live="polite"` because the sentence exists nowhere else: its legend
          items are named "Weights 14 GiB" and the explanation is not part of that name. Here the
          sentence *is* the focused cell's accessible name, verbatim — so a live region carrying it
          would say every cell twice, once as the name and once as the announcement, on every press
          of an arrow key across a row — 42 columns as the catalog stands at this commit, so a walk
          across one goes from 42 sentences to 84. The channel this adds is the visual one, which is
          precisely the channel the three readers in #71 were missing; the spoken one was already
          there, and is the reason the duplicate would be so expensive.

          `tabular`, because the figures change under the sliders and a readout whose digits shift
          width as it counts is the thing `index.css` reserves that class for. */}

      {/* A ramp legend, since a continuous scale has no discrete keys to list.
          `flex-wrap`, because several of the seven entries are whole sentences and the row does not
          fit a phone.
          Unlike the grid above it this div has no scroll container of its own, so a row that
          overran did not scroll itself — it scrolled the page. At 320px the legend measured 299px
          inside a 246px box and took the document to 336/320. Issue #34; guarded by
          `e2e/matrix-legend.spec.ts`, since jsdom reports every one of those widths as 0. */}
      <div className="mt-4 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-x-3 gap-y-2 text-xs text-[var(--color-text-muted)]">
        {/* The ramp and its two ends are one item, with a floor under it.
            `flex-1` is `flex: 1 1 0%`, so the gradient's flex basis is zero and it is the only
            thing here that yields when the row is tight — which it was at every width below about
            1280px once the third key appeared. The ramp measured 0×12 on a 1024px laptop: the
            legend's entire subject, absent, while the prose explaining the exceptions sat at full
            width. Wrapping alone does not fix that, because a zero-basis item on a full line still
            gets no space: it survives wherever a line breaks early (139.8px at 390) and collapses
            wherever the keys nearly fill one (13.6px at 1024). A floor is what makes the ramp
            claim a width and, failing that, take a line of its own — `min-width` is resolved into
            the hypothetical main size, so it governs line-breaking and shrinking alike.
            Capped at `100%`, not left at a bare `12rem`, because a rem floor is a floor the
            viewport cannot argue with: under browser text scaling the root grows while the
            viewport does not, and at 320px with a 24px root the floor alone took the document to
            343/320 — reintroducing the sideways scroll this whole block exists to remove, in the
            one setting a reader most needs it not to. `min()` yields instead.

            **The endpoints are what make this a scale rather than an ordering** (#71). `worse` and
            `better` alone say which way to read the ramp and nothing about what it spans, so a
            mid-blue under "How fast" could be 20 tok/s or 200 — and since `fill` log-scales, the
            colour is deliberately a rank, which leaves no other route to a magnitude. They are the
            extremes of the values actually on the grid, not a per-step key — and for `fit` and
            `decode`, whose ramps anchor at zero, the lowest cell need not paint the first step at
            all. Under `ttft` the domain is the grid's own span and it does (#97). The claim is the
            span either way.

            The two throughput figures come off the cell at that end rather than out of the ramp value,
            which is argued at `MeasureRange` — for TTFT they would otherwise be a floating-point round
            trip, and printed the wrong way round if anyone sorted them by the number instead of by
            rank. `fit`'s low figure is the ramp's own value and says so at `rampEnd`: every offloaded
            cell scores exactly zero headroom, so the dark end of that ramp is a population rather than
            a cell.

            **Two figures in this row is why the floor moves from 12rem to 20rem, and why the ramp now
            carries one of its own.** The ramp is still the only item here with a zero flex basis, so
            it is still the only thing that collapses, and it now shares its line with about 190px of
            text: "worse 0.4 tok/s" and "1449 tok/s better" at the widest the catalog reaches. 20rem
            leaves it ~100px on that line instead of the 13.6px #34 measured, `min(…, 100%)` keeps
            that from being a floor a 320px viewport cannot meet, and the ramp's own floor is what
            makes it take a line rather than vanish where even 20rem is too tight — a zero-basis item
            on a shared line takes only the space left over, which is the whole lesson of #34's second
            half.

            **The `nowrap` protects the figure and its unit, and nothing more — `PanelCount`'s rule
            from #35, which is where that shape was settled.** The first version of this put the
            direction word and the figure in one non-wrapping item, which makes each end's min-content
            the whole label: 17 characters at the widest the scenario space reaches ("1011 tok/s
            better", measured across three runtimes, every catalogued format, 4K/32K/128K of context
            and 1/8/128 users). A 320px viewport leaves about 262px inside this panel — 12.8px of page
            padding and 16px of panel padding a side — and 17 characters of the 24px monospace a 200%
            reader gets is roughly 245px of it: true today, true by about a character, and on a
            quantity that moves whenever a device is added. Protecting the figure alone takes the
            floor to the longest *figure* instead ("1011 tok/s", 10 characters), and lets "worse" fall
            to its own line in the one setting where the alternative is a label leaving the panel —
            which is exactly the trade `PanelCount` makes for "12 of 425" and the noun after it.
            Measured in `e2e/matrix-legend.spec.ts` at the decode measure, where the longest labels
            are, and at 200% in `e2e/reflow.spec.ts` with the stress font on `--font-mono` as well,
            since `.tabular` resolves that variable and the sweep only ever stressed `--font-sans`. */}

            The gap is a mark this legend keys every neighbour of — the dashed border, the struck
            heading, the selection ring, the warning border — and it shipped with its only sentence
            inside a `sr-only` caption, so a screen-reader user was told the columns are grouped and a
            sighted reader met two channels of whitespace with nothing on the page naming them. That is
            #73's asymmetry, in the same direction and on the same surface. A boundary legible only to
            someone who already knows that `dgx-spark` is not a discrete GPU is not a channel a legend
            gets to rely on.

            The bands are named here in order, so the key also answers the question the gap raises
            rather than only labelling it — which makes this the visible half of the caption's column
            sentence rather than a second copy of it. The words come from `DEVICE_CLASS_LABELS`, the
            same table the picker's `<optgroup>` headings come from.

            The sample *is* the mark, like the struck heading above: two squares in the empty-cell
            colour with the real gap between them, `w-2` being the `2 × --spacing` the columns spend.

      {/* **Last in the panel, and sticky, and those two together are the fix** (#71, both halves
          found in review).

          Sticky, because the paragraph used to sit after a 17-row table: a keyboard reader arrowing
          across the first rows had the figures rendered below the fold, and the cell's native `title`
          does not cover them — it needs a pointer and a dwell, so it serves the mouse reader and not
          the one who had nothing before this. `bottom-0` on an element in flow keeps it on screen
          without taking it out of the layout.

          Last in the panel, which is necessary and — as review pointed out — **not sufficient, and my
          first rationale for it was wrong.** "Nothing follows it to push" is true inside this panel
          and false on the page: a paragraph whose height changes changes this section's height and
          shoves whatever is downstream of it down. When #71 landed that was the Usage panel, which
          `Bench.tsx` rendered immediately after `<Matrix>`; #66 moved those controls to the top of the
          page, so today it is the MoE aside and the document's own height. Being last removes the
          legend from the blast radius; it does not remove the page, and which panel happens to be
          downstream is not something this reservation should depend on.

          So the height is **reserved per breakpoint**, from measurement rather than taste. The
          sentence is a full model-and-device line, and its widest rendering — a spilled cell's, which
          since #127 carries `HOST_RAM_UNCHECKED` as a second sentence — is 80px at 320 and 60 at
          390 (the brief form, unchanged by the qualifier), 60 at 640 and 768, 40 at 1024 and up:
          four lines, three, three, two. The reservation follows that: `5rem` below `sm`, `3.75rem`
          at `sm`, `2.5rem` at `lg`. It costs 60px of reserved blank space on a phone — and one
          more line at `sm` and `lg` than before #127, which is the measured price of the spilled
          qualifier — and buys a layout that does not move as the reader arrows across a row.

          A constant measured from today's device names is exactly the trap #44 records — #78
          lengthened them in this same sweep — so it is not left to hold by luck: `matrix-readout`
          sweeps every cell at 320 and 640 and fails if any sentence renders taller than the space
          reserved for it. A longer name added later breaks that test rather than the layout.

          `pointer-events-none`, because a pinned opaque bar over a grid of buttons otherwise
          swallows clicks meant for the cells behind it, and this paragraph is `aria-hidden`
          decoration with nothing to click. The cells carry `scroll-mb` to match the reservation, so
          the browser's own focus scrolling leaves the bar's height clear instead of parking the
          focused cell behind it.

          No vertical padding: `min-h` is a border-box floor, so padding sits inside it while the
          line is empty and adds to it once there is text — 4px of movement per sentence, which is
          the thing this is all for. */}
      {/* **Sticky to the bottom of the viewport while the grid is on screen** (found in review).

          The comment on the cell's `title` above concedes that this grid is 17 rows tall and a reader
          at the top of it can have the readout below the fold — and treats the native tooltip as the
          channel that covers that case. It does not: `title` needs a pointer and a dwell, so a sighted
          *keyboard* reader arrowing across the first rows had the figures rendered somewhere they
          could not see, which is #71's defect surviving its own fix for the reader who had the least
          before it.
          `sticky` rather than `fixed`, and `bottom-0` on the element that is already in flow, so it
          occupies its own space in the layout and reflows nothing: the paragraph sits where it always
          did and merely stops scrolling out of view while the panel is. `min-h` already reserved the
          line against text scaling, which is what keeps this from shifting the legend below it as the
          sentence appears and disappears.
          A surface of its own — `--color-surface` plus the panel's horizontal padding pulled back out
          with negative margins — because a line of text pinned over a scrolling grid of coloured
          squares is unreadable against half of them. No vertical padding with it: `min-h` is a
          border-box floor, so padding is inside it while the line is empty and *adds* to it once
          there is a line of text — 4px of legend movement every time a sentence appears, which is
          precisely the reflow the reservation exists to prevent. The sibling test caught it. */}

   * only by spilling 66% of its weights to host RAM" — and carries the constant. The narrow form
   * says "spills 66% to host RAM", which is the spill stated as a fact, with no verb claiming the
   * thing loads. Qualifying it would be qualifying a promise nobody made.
   *
   * *The channels that do promise are not width-dependent.* The `title` and the cell's `aria-label`
   * are both `sentences[r][c].full` — the constant rides at 320px exactly as it does at 1440.
   *
   * *And the colour is not a third promise.* `measureValue` returns 0 for a spilled cell under
   * `fit` — the dimmest step, categorical rather than a degree — so the grid paints a spilled fit
   * at the bottom of its own ramp rather than as a comfortable one.
   *
   * *Against that, the price is permanent and the wording does not survive it.* Measured at 200%
   * text on a 320px viewport, where the rem floor doubles while the line width halves: the full
   * constant needs a 10rem floor and the inline-clause register still needs 7.5rem — 120px of
   * permanently reserved blank space on a phone against 80px today, paid on every page view
   * whether or not the grid holds a spilled cell. And `HOST_RAM_UNCHECKED_BRIEF` cannot simply be
   * appended: it reads "if the host has room for **them**", where "them" is the *weights* the
   * Envelope's count line names one clause earlier. This sentence names no weights, so the
   * capitalised fragment lands with a dangling pronoun and granting the caveat properly needs a
   * third spelling of one fact — which is the drift the two-register pair exists to prevent.
   *
   * What the finding got right and this does not repair: the legend's keyed line is non-sticky, so
   * the panel-level channel is off screen at the moment the sticky readout exists for. It is the
