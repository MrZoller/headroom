        The three tracks live on the list, not on the row.

        With the grid on each `<li>` every row was its own grid container, so the middle `auto`
        track was sized from that row's own label — and the written reason, which is the third
        column, started at a different x on all seven rows: 444 to 503 at 1440px, 59px of rag. The
        first track is fixed at `9rem`, so the status word and the label lined up regardless, and
        that alignment is exactly what makes the third one read as a column rather than as prose.
        It is the column that carries the panel's whole argument — seven archetypes, seven answers,
        each explained in writing — and scanning those reasons against each other is what a
        wandering left edge stops the eye doing (#70).

        Subgrid on the row rather than `display: contents`, which is the other way to share one set
        of tracks. Two reasons, and neither is the one this repo was bitten by before (the Bench's
        `contents` scroll anchor, which generated no principal box): a row that generates no box is
        a `<li>` that shipping browsers drop from the accessibility tree, so a seven-item list is
        announced as an empty one; and `order` applies among siblings of one container, so with the
        rows dissolved the mobile stacking below would sort all twenty-one cells into a block of
        labels, a block of status words and a block of reasons instead of seven rows. Subgrid keeps
        the row a real box and keeps its `order` scoped to it.

        Fixing the middle track instead — a guessed 11rem in place of `auto` — aligns the columns
        today and silently overflows on the first archetype label longer than "Inline code
        completion". A subgrid over an `auto` track is that measurement taken rather than guessed.

        The support check the issue asked for: subgrid is Baseline widely available — Firefox 71,
        Safari 16, Chrome and Edge 117, which is September 2023 plus the thirty months Baseline
        waits. It is *not*, however, inside Vite's default build target, which floors at Chrome 111
        (`baseline-widely-available` resolves to chrome111/edge111/firefox114/safari16.4), so Chrome
        and Edge 111 to 116 are browsers this build targets and the feature is missing from. There
        the value is invalid, the declaration is dropped, and the row is left with no column
        template — which is the reason the row's own two-column template is `max-sm:`-scoped rather
        than unscoped. Unscoped it survives into those browsers past `sm` and, with `sm:order-none`
        cancelling the stacking, renders `● Yes` *before* the label — reversing both layouts we
        actually support. Scoped, the row falls back to one implicit column and the three cells
        stack in DOM order, which is the same sequence they read in left to right: ugly, complete,
        and confined to browsers older than the feature. No `@supports` branch to restore the
        three-column table for them, because that branch would have to re-declare the per-row
        tracks this issue is about, unexercised by any test, for browsers that update themselves.

                **The `nowrap` is `sm:`-scoped, and that is a reflow fix rather than a tidy-up.** At
                `sm` and above this cell sits in a *fixed* `9rem` track: nothing it contains can widen
                the layout, and a status word must not wrap there or the row's one line becomes two
                and the column stops being a column. Below `sm` the row is its own
                `grid-cols-[auto_1fr]` and this cell is the `1fr`, whose automatic minimum is its
                min-content — so an unbreakable string here is a hard floor on the width of the whole
                row, and the row is inside a panel inside the document.

                Three short words never reached that floor. "Not measured" did: measured in Chromium
                at `reflow.spec.ts`'s own configuration — 320x900, `defaultFontSize=32`, `--font-sans`
                set to Courier New — that row's status cell had a min-content of 199px against 55px
                for "○ No", which took `documentElement.scrollWidth` to 371px in a 320px viewport and
                put 29 elements outside the document. That is WCAG 1.4.4 (#35), the criterion this
                repo already shipped a failure of once. Letting the word wrap below `sm` dropped the
                same cell to 142px and the document back to 320/320, because the floor becomes the
                longest *word* rather than the whole string.

                **The string that needed it is gone and the scoping stays** (#96): the ungraded state
                was removed at its root, so the longest status word is now "Tight". Kept because the
                mechanism is what is right — an unbreakable string in the `1fr` of a stacked row is a
                hard floor on the document's width — and the next status word is one grade away from
                reintroducing it. Deleting the scope would make that a 1.4.4 regression discovered in
                a browser instead of never happening.

                At the default text size it never wraps — on a 390px phone the cell holds 96px of
                content in a 188px track, and even at 320px 96px in 131px — so this costs nothing on
                the layout anyone actually arrives at.

                  The circles are ~11.1px at this size and the em dash the ungraded row used was
                  10.5px; before this the word's left edge moved with the glyph, which put "Not
                  measured" 4.1px left of the other six in the column #70 exists to have aligned — and
                  every alignment assertion in `e2e/workload-columns.spec.ts` kept passing, because
                  they measure the *cell* box. The three glyphs left after #96 are one width, so the
                  box is inert today and is the reason the next one cannot break the column.

                  `w-3` is `0.75rem`, the same length as `text-xs`, so the box is one em at every root
                  size and a glyph wider than the box is centred rather than nudging the word.
                  `shrink-0` so a cell tighter than its track cannot take the width back out of it.

                  Scoped to `sm` because below it there is no shared column to align to — the status
                  word follows a label of the row's own width — and because a fixed box is +10px of
                  min-content at 200% text, which is most of the slack the wrap fix above just bought.
