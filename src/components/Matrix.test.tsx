       **What the bound is for, stated so the next person does not have to infer it:** the defect is
       1,506, not 41. Forty was an order-of-magnitude line drawn against that, never a budget. What
       it catches is a whole *collection* re-entering the sequence — a grid, a table, a list of
       cells — and 55 catches that exactly as well as 40 did, because the failure mode is three
       orders of magnitude away and not one panel away.

       **The pressure underneath it is real and is not a test problem.** Four panels landed on one
       page in one pass, and a page that keeps adding panels is the thing to look at before this
       number is raised a third time. Shedding stops was considered and declined: the copy buttons
       could be one shared button at the cost of the reader knowing which command they copied, and
       the provenance links are the "flags drift" trap #136 names. The command block's stop is
       Chrome's own and not this app's to remove. */

/**
 * A mark drawn *on* the heatmap, measured against the heatmap.
 *
 * The rule above — focus and a resting state never share a channel — moved the Matrix's
 * selected-square mark from an offset ring outside the cell to a frame inside it, and that moved it
 * off `--color-surface`, where `tokens.ts` validated the accent at 7.14:1, and onto the ramp, where
 * it was never validated at all. A single-tone accent frame measures **1.06:1 to 4.52:1** across
 * the seven steps of `sequential` — below the 3:1 non-text minimum on 304 of the grid's 408 squares,
 * the default selection among them. So the mark is two tones, and this is the arithmetic that says
 * so: for every fill the grid actually paints, at least one of the mark's tones has to clear 3:1
 * against it.
 *
 * **jsdom can answer this one, which is why it is here rather than in the browser suite.** The fill
 * is an inline style and the mark's tones are token names in the class list; the rest is the WCAG
 * contrast formula. What jsdom cannot answer — whether the two tones land in the geometry the class
 * list implies, 2px of accent with the separator inside it — is `e2e/focus-indicators.spec.ts`.
