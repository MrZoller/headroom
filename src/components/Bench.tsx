 * viewport, and DOM order is reading order, so it is also what a screen-reader user meets first. The
 * Usage panel's own comment records what it cost when those five controls were last on the page
 * (#66), and `App.test.tsx` pins the order so a panel added later cannot slip in between.

   * interconnect, so it never divides anything.

            `overrideNote` anyway.

            it describes instead of taking a cell of its own and pushing Hardware down a row. The

      {/* Usage: the half of the question that is about you, not the hardware.

          **Second on the page, directly under Setup, and that placement is the fix** (#66). These
          five controls drove every figure that used to precede them — the memory bar, the three
          verdict tiles, the workload strip, the Envelope, and a Matrix whose heading states the very
          scenario they set ("32K context, 8K prompt, 1 user, FP16 KV"). At 1440x900 the context
          slider sat 2,260px below the bar it fills when the issue measured it and 2,402px by the time
          this landed, two and a half viewport heights either way; on an iPhone 14 the gap was 3,505px
          and the two were never on screen together at any scroll position. A page whose premise is the
          docstring above — "drag usage, watch the budget fill" — cannot put the drag and the fill in
          different viewports, so every panel was an answer to a question the reader could not see
          themselves asking. Both gaps are now inside one viewport: 388px at 1440x900, 683px at 390x844.

          DOM order is reading order, so the same distance was the screen-reader cost: six panels of
          output before the first input. #52 fixed the keyboard half — 422 Tab presses down to 15 —
          and deliberately scoped the placement out, as a layout decision rather than a reachability
          bug. This is that decision, made the other way.

          **What it costs, measured rather than waved at.** The landing view no longer holds a figure.
          At 1440x900 the two control panels run 281–901 and the memory bar's top is 978, so at scroll
          0 there are 620px of input and nothing computed; before this the bar sat at 602 and the
          verdict tiles at 785, both on screen. The trade is deliberate — a reader who arrives, drags,
          and scrolls 100px sees the bar respond, where before they had to scroll past the whole
          catalog to find the slider at all — but it is a trade, not a free win, and the thing that
          would remove it is the sticky summary strip #66 named and scoped out. Merging the two panels
          would not: that recovers the gap between them, not 620px of controls.

          Kept as two panels rather than merged into one `sm:grid-cols-2` grid now that they are
          adjacent. They are two landmarks with two names, and "what are you running" and "how are
          you using it" are two questions; a reader hunting for the context slider is helped by a
          region called Usage more than by nine controls under one heading.

          The labels come from `SETTING_LABELS` rather than being written here, because the Envelope
          draws two of these settings as its axes and titles them with the same words. The notes come
          from `SETTING_NOTES` for the same reason and one more: these five controls *are* the
          KV-cache argument — context times users times bits per token is most of what the budget bar
          draws — and until they carried a sentence each, the panel's whole text content was the
          labels and the values, with the argument made only in `Envelope.tsx`'s docstring (#80).

          **And the same section is now in the heading outline** (#74), which compounded with the
          placement above rather than being separate from it: while these five controls were the last
          thing on the page, they were also absent from the one navigation mechanism that would have
          got a screen-reader user to them without travelling the whole document. */}

          The anchor is where a Matrix click scrolls back to: the detail it loads sits several
          sections above the grid, so without one the viewport stayed on an unchanged Matrix and
          the click looked like it had done nothing.

          It stays *below* the Usage panel, which is a positional claim and not an accident. A Matrix
          click changes the model and device — the detail is the budget bar and the tiles, not the
          sliders — so aiming the anchor at the top of the controls would scroll two panels of input
          into view and push the figures the click actually loaded back under the fold. #66 moved the

                This sentence claims what a token physically reads and then attributes the speed to
                it, so it has to print the physical count. `activeParams` is not that: it is the
                *published* convention, and `publishedActiveParams` is not one rule — it returns
                `totalParams` outright on a dense model and only on an MoE rebuilds an
                embedding-subtracted dense residual with the routed share added back. It therefore
                disagrees with the physical count wherever the two exclude different things: a
                non-language tower, an untied input embedding on a dense row, or a *tied* one on an
                MoE, which the published branch subtracts and the physical basis keeps. Mistral Small
                4 printed 6.524B against a 6.096B basis; Command A+ is the third case and runs the
                other way, 0.578B low.

                `speed.ts` divides by neither — `estimateDecode` reads `activeWeightBytes`, which
                prices the dense and expert halves at their own widths. This is the parameter count
                behind that byte figure, which is what makes it the honest thing to print beside a
                sentence about what a token routes through.

                **`activeDenseParams` alone was the wrong correction, and review caught it before it
                shipped.** That field is only the always-active dense part: `effectiveActiveParams`
                is `activeDenseParams + expertParams * expertFraction(model, batch)`, so dropping the
                routed experts understated every MoE — Kimi K2 as 10.6B where a token traverses about
                31.7B. One error replaced by a larger one in the opposite direction.

                Batch one, because the sentence is about a token rather than about a deployment, and
                `expertFraction` grows with the batch as more of the expert union gets touched. The
                figure beside it in the picker stays `activeParams` (line 179), which is right — that
