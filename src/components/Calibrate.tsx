 * and nobody is asked to. Paste `llama-bench` output beside the prediction for the same scenario,
 * see both, and — optionally — submit the pair as a pre-filled issue.
 *
 * **Behind a disclosure, and that is a judgement rather than a default.** This is the one panel on
 * the page a reader has to have already done something to use: it wants the output of a command
 * they ran on their own machine. Open by default it is a large empty textarea on every page view,
 * which is what the surface would look like if the feature were about collecting data rather than
 * about being checkable.
 *
 * **The rule that guards it, from the issue and unchanged: measurements accumulate as evidence, and
 * retuning stays a deliberate act.** Nothing here writes to the engine's constants, and nothing
 * about a submitted number is applied automatically. Submissions in bulk are how
 * `bandwidthEfficiency` × `CLASS_BANDWIDTH_UTILIZATION` finally becomes identifiable; a drip of
 * individually-absorbed measurements is how the next masked error gets fitted into the constants
 * silently.
