/**
 * The Envelope: how much room is left, as a region rather than a number.
 *
 * The Bench answers "does this work at my settings". People actually want to know how far they
 * can push before it stops working, and that is a shape — context on X, concurrent users on Y,
 * the two things a deployment grows in and the two that multiply into the KV cache.
 *
 * Drawn on canvas rather than as DOM cells because the grid is dense and redrawn on every
 * slider frame; a table view carries the same figures for anyone who cannot use the picture.
 *
 * **The fill is a magnitude, and the verdict deliberately is not the fill** (#65). Painted from the
 * three-state classification, the default scenario came out 45 of 56 cells in one amber with one
 * cell green: a channel carrying almost nothing, in front of readings that span 20x of decode and
 * 561x of first-token latency. And *none* of the amber was amber for capacity — the tight-on-capacity
 * band is the last tenth of the ceiling, while both axes double per step, so the grid goes from 82%
 * of the ceiling straight to 112% and the one threshold that could have drawn a boundary out of the
 * two quantities these axes measure is skipped in every column. The field titled "how much room is
 * left" was coloured entirely by speed and latency.
 *
 * So the fill takes a step of `magnitudeRamp` under a measure the reader chooses, exactly as the
 * Matrix does: the same three questions over different axes, the same control, the same `MEASURES`.
 * Capacity gets a whole channel instead of a threshold nothing lands in. The verdict is not lost —
 * it is in this panel's count, in every row of the table, in the ring's sentence and in the canvas
 * description, which are the channels that can carry a word.
 */

/**
 * What each state is called — and, for the three that are not magnitudes, what colour it is.
 *
 * **A `fill` here means "this state is not a point on any scale".** `over` and `unsupported` are
 * refusals, and `offloaded` is a different placement rather than a worse one: its weights cross the
 * host bus every token, which is a structural fact a reader can act on and the most common
 * explanation for a machine being mysteriously slow. Grading those on a ramp would be answering
 * "how much room is left" for a configuration that has already run out of it. Everything else — the
 * cells that fit resident, whether the verdict called them comfortable or tight — is a magnitude,
 * and takes its colour from `fieldFill`.
 *
 * The three that keep a colour keep the reserved *status* hues, not the budget series: `tokens.ts`
 * validates that trio, and this set was measured separately — worst normal-vision pair is
 * serious/critical at ΔE 20.7, worst CVD is good/warning at ~13.7 under protanopia. Both hues still
 * in use sit in a different family from the blue ramp, so a state cannot read as a step of it.
 *
 * All five keep a label and a hint, including the two with no colour left. The words are still what
 * the header count, the table and the ring's sentence say, and the legend still defines them — as
 * prose rather than as a key, which is the shape a thing with no mark has to take.

   * `{ min: v, max: v }`, where `magnitudeFill` returns the brightest step for any non-positive span.
   * All three measures then paint that cell identically while every other cell keeps its categorical
   * fill, so the control was offered and pressing it moved `aria-pressed` and nothing else. Reachable:
   * Qwen3-14B at Q5_K_M on one RTX 5070 under llama.cpp has exactly 1 graded cell against 20 spilling
   * and 35 over the ceiling. `max > min` rather than `length > 1`, because two cells reading the same
   * value are the same degenerate domain as one — and because that is the condition `magnitudeFill`
   * itself tests.
   *
   * **Whether the switch should exist at all is a different question**, and deriving it from the
   * selected measure removed the way back. One measure can be flat while another varies: Gemma 3 27B
   * at INT8 on the 36 GiB M4 Max under MLX with a 512-token prompt has two graded cells whose headroom
   * and decode rate differ and whose TTFT is identical to the last digit. The control appeared under
   * `fit`, the reader chose "How responsive", and the fieldset — the only route to any other measure —
   * disappeared with it. A control that removes itself in response to being used is worse than the
   * dead one this gate replaced.
   *
   * So the switch is offered while *any* measure varies, and the ramp key, the ramp clause and the
   * canvas sentence are withheld per selected measure. A flat measure is then a legible state rather
   * than a dead end: the buttons stay, the caption still says what this measure paints, and nothing

          The y title, stacked above the gutter rather than rotated beside it.

          Rotating it is the conventional choice, and the cost is worth stating accurately because
          the wrong figure is what a later session would inherit: a `writing-mode: vertical-rl`
          title costs one line box of horizontal space — a fraction of one `MIN_COLUMN_REM` column
          — and none of the plot's content width, only its scroll viewport. (A `rotate-90`
          *transform* is the expensive one: transforms do not affect layout, so it reserves the
          label's full unrotated length.) So this is a legibility call rather than a width one:
          12px type turned on its side, on the surface whose whole complaint was that its meaning
          rode on the least legible ink, and an arrow that has to read as up. Stacked it costs one
          line of vertical space, which this panel has and the width it does not.

          The arrow is the point of it, not decoration. Rows are drawn bottom-up (see the paint
          effect below), which is correct for an axis and the opposite of every other list on this
          page: a reader who assumes top-to-bottom reads the default field as "128 users at 2K is
          the comfortable one" when it is 1 user at 2K — close to the opposite claim. That
          direction was stated only in a source comment until now (#81).

          `aria-hidden`, like the tick labels either side of it, because the canvas `aria-label` is
          this picture's textual equivalent and already names both quantities. Visible titles that

          `flex-wrap` with the gradient's floor capped at `100%`, for the reason recorded on the
          Matrix's legend (#34) and on `min-w-[min(12rem,100%)]` in the ROADMAP: a bare rem floor is
          a floor the viewport cannot argue with, so under browser text scaling it takes the document
          into a sideways scroll at 320px. Capped, the gradient claims its own line instead.

          Only while some cell is actually graded. Under a runtime that cannot drive the device the
          whole field is one flat red, and a ramp key there describes a scale nothing on screen is
          painted from.

          **The ends name the quantity, not a verdict, and the difference is measured.** They said
          "worse" and "better" — the Matrix's words for the same seven hexes — while this ramp's
          domain is the grid's own span and the Matrix's is floored at zero. On gpt-oss-20b against an
          EPYC 9755 all 56 cells run, the `fit` domain is 0.726 to 0.991 of the ceiling free, and the
          darkest step lands on the 128K x 128-user corner with 1,052 of 1,450 allocatable GiB unused: keyed
          "worse", the
          legend told the reader the emptiest machine in the catalogue was out of room. `MEASURES.ends`
          says "less room" instead, which is the strongest claim a rank-relative ramp is entitled to,

 * How far context reaches at the fewest users before comfort runs out — the comfortable region's

 *
 * **This exists because the header's comfort count has to be locatable somewhere a reader looks.**
 * The field is a magnitude now (#65), so "comfortable" is deliberately not a colour: at the default
 * scenario the one comfortable cell is painted `#cde2fb` and so are 27 tight ones, 28 of 56 sharing
 * that hex. That is the right call for the fill — measured, the verdict channel carried 45 of 56 in
 * one amber while hiding two orders of magnitude — but it left "1 of 56 comfortable" captioning a
 * picture in which the 1 is half the grid, identifiable only in a table behind a disclosure. The
 * verdict lives in the channels that carry words, so the *location* has to as well, and the legend's
 * swatch-less "Comfortable" line is where a reader goes to find out what the word means.
 *
 * Derived once rather than written twice: the description already said this and the legend did not,
 * which is the shape of drift this file has now hit four times.
 *
 * `undefined` when no cell in the fewest-users row is comfortable, which includes the whole grid
 * being closed. Both callers are already inside a "some cell is comfortable" branch, and a row-0 miss
 * with comfort further up is not a frontier this phrase could state honestly.
 *
 * The column is named by its **axis label**, not by `tokens()` on the raw count (#120) — the same
 * repair the ring clause already carries, missed here: a hand-edited `?ctx=131073` beside 131,072
 * makes `uniqueLabels` print both headers as exact counts, and this phrase then said "up to 128K"
 * — a label matching no column on the axis, ambiguous between the two it sits astride, in the
 * legend's Comfortable line and the canvas description both. `tokens()` stays only as the fallback
 * for a column the axis does not hold, mirroring the ring clause's own.
