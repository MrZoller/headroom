/**
 * The memory budget, as a stacked bar against the allocatable ceiling.
 *
 * This is the hero. The whole argument of the tool is visible in one shape: weights are a fixed
 * block, KV grows as you drag context and concurrency, and the ceiling does not move. When the
 * stack passes the ceiling the bar says so structurally — an overflow region beyond the line —
 * rather than by turning red, because "it turned red" does not tell you *by how much*.
 *
 * **That structural claim inverts at a large overshoot, and the sentence has to take over** (#73).
 * `scale` follows the stack, so past roughly 3x the ceiling the *budget* becomes the sliver and the
 * overflow becomes the whole picture: at 14x, DeepSeek V3 on a 5090 draws a full bar of segments
 * with the ceiling 7% from the left edge, which reads as "nearly full" rather than "fourteen times
 * over". The fix is not a different scale — keeping the stack on screen is still right — it is that
 * the multiple is stated in words past the point the shape can carry it. See `OVERSHOOT_STATED`.
 *
 * Colour is never the only channel here: every segment carries a direct label and a 2px surface
 * gap, and the same figures are available as a table for anyone who cannot use the bar at all.

 * 3x, because that is where the two halves of the picture change places: at 3x the budget occupies
 * the left third of the bar and the gap is still legible as a proportion, and past it the ceiling
 * rule closes on the left edge while the segments fill everything. Below the threshold the multiple
 * is the absolute overage said a second way — "over by 3.1 GiB" *and* "1.1x the ceiling" — and a
 * clause that appears on every overflow is a clause people learn to skip, including on the
 * configurations where it is the only thing telling them the scale.
 *
 * It is also the boundary the table's ratio column switches form at (`shareOfCeiling`), so this
 * panel has one answer to "has this ratio left the neighbourhood of 1" rather than two thresholds
 * that can disagree about the same figure in two channels.

   * and contradicts the capacity verdict a few pixels away. Removing every weight still leaves
   * this configuration over, and the bar has the figures to say so.
   *
   * Split on `canOffload`, for the same reason `capacityReading` in Telemetry does: a discrete GPU
   * and a Mac both reach `impossible`, by different routes. Testing the non-offloadable floor
   * instead read that Mac as an overflowing 5090 and told it to spill, on a machine with no tier
   * to spill to — the two panels sit one above the other and described the same placement two

   * `floorBytesPerDevice` rather than this panel's own `kvBytesPerDevice + activationBytesPerDevice`,

   * refused. Those two agree on every rig whose devices hold the same amount, and part company under
   * a layer split — Gemma 3 12B on three 4090s at 128K and 8 users is impossible because two cards
   * need 24.6 GiB of cache and workspace against a 23 GiB ceiling, while the card the rest of this
   * bar describes needs 19.1. Rebuilt here, the sentence read "the cache and overhead alone need
   * 19.1 GiB" under a header reading 23.0 GiB, and disproved the claim it was making.
   *
   * Which leaves the figure true of a device the segments beside it are not drawing, so the sentence
   * says whose it is. Naming the card is cheaper than the alternatives — redrawing the bar for a
   * device the user did not ask about, or going back to a figure that reconciles with the segments

            segments occupy the whole width and no empty track is left for the rule to sit on; which
            fill it lands on is the only thing the overshoot changes. Dashed critical red over
            saturated blue at 14x is the worst pairing this palette contains, and 1.1x is no better
            — there the rule falls at 91%, inside the amber cache that took the configuration over.
            Either way the gaps between the dashes show the fill, and the line half disappears into
            the thing it is supposed to be measuring.

            A halo rather than a heavier or solid line: the same 2px of track colour the segments
            already put between themselves via `marks.gap`, and the same mechanism the Envelope's
            "you are here" ring and the Matrix's selected cell already use — a mark that overlaps
            another is separated by surface, never by more ink. The dashes then read against the
            track wherever the line falls.

            What the halo does not survive is either edge of the bar, and the position is what gives
            way rather than the reference. It is a fixed `lineWidth + 2·gap` centred on the rule, and
            the bar clips its children, so a stack barely over the ceiling puts the rule at 99.5% and
            loses the right gap, and one hundreds of times over loses the left. Clamping it inward
            would keep the separation whole by drawing the ceiling somewhere the ceiling is not, which
