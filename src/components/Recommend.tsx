/**
 * What this machine should run (#138).
 *
 * The question people arrive with — *"I want a local coding assistant, what is the best model I
 * can run?"* — asked of the catalog rather than of one configuration. The Matrix holds this answer
 * as 1,470 cells to interpret; this returns the decision, and every row deep-links back into the
 * Bench so "why that verdict" is one click and the explain layer does the explaining.
 *
 * **Three things about it are deliberate and would each be easy to get wrong.**
 *
 * *The rules are printed.* A ranked list is a recommendation, and a recommendation with an unstated
 * basis is an opinion wearing the chassis of a measurement. `RANKING_RULE`, `QUANT_RULE` and — when
 * it fires — `FALLBACK_RULE` are rendered under the shortlist, verbatim from the engine, because a
 * near-copy here is how the printed rule and the implemented one come apart.
 *
 * *The axes are named.* The sweep fixes device count and KV precision, and those are the reader's
 * current settings rather than universal truths — so the footer says which machine and which cache
 * the list describes. Without that, a shortlist read after moving a slider is a claim about a
 * configuration nobody is looking at.
 *
 * *A spilled row carries the host-RAM qualifier*, like every other surface that says a spilled
 * configuration runs. `planPlacement` sizes a spill with no host-RAM input at all, and this is the
 * surface most read as a shortlist — which is exactly the position the Matrix was in when #127 was
 * filed against it.
