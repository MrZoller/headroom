/**
 * The per-token figure in the Bench's aside, which claims to be what sets the speed (#77 review).
 *
 * Three quantities are in play and they differ by enough to matter on the models this catalog exists
 * for. `activeParams` is the *published* convention: `publishedActiveParams` returns `totalParams`
 * outright on a dense model and only on an MoE rebuilds an embedding-subtracted dense residual with
 * the routed share added back. It disagrees with the physical count wherever the two **exclude
 * different things**, which is three cases and not one: a non-language tower, an untied input
 * embedding on a dense row, and — the one two drafts of this missed — a **tied** input embedding on
 * an MoE, which the published figure subtracts unconditionally and `activeDenseParams` correctly
 * keeps, a tied table being the output projection. Command A+ is that case, and it is why its
 * published figure is 0.578B *low* where Mistral Small 4's is 7% high: the omitted 1.074B table
 * outweighs the included 0.495B tower. `activeDenseParams` is the always-active dense part and
 * excludes the routed experts. `effectiveActiveParams(model, 1)` is the physical count, and the one
 * this sentence has to print.
 *
 * `speed.ts` divides by neither, which is worth saying here because the aside sounds as though it
 * does: `estimateDecode` reads `activeWeightBytes`, which prices the dense and expert halves at
 * their own widths — about a factor of two on an expert-only scheme like MXFP4, where the dense
 * tensors stay BF16. `effectiveActiveParams` is the parameter count behind that byte figure.
 *
 * Both wrong answers shipped briefly during #77 and each was caught by review rather than by a test:
 * `activeParams` overstated Mistral Small 4 (6.524B against a 6.096B basis),
 * and the correction to `activeDenseParams` understated every MoE in the other direction, by a
 * ratio that spans the catalog rather than one factor (Kimi K2 at 10.6B where a token traverses
 * 31.75B, but 1.91x on GLM-4.7-Flash and 8.65x on Mixtral). So this pins the sentence to the
 * engine's own expression, and asserts the two near neighbours are *not* what it prints — a test that
 * only checked the value against `effectiveActiveParams` would have passed on a dense model either
 * way, since all three coincide there.
