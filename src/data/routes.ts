/**
 * The paths the site is built as files for, and how to read one back.
 *
 * Two directions of the same fact, deliberately in one module ([#178](https://github.com/MrZoller/headroom/issues/178)):
 *
 *   - {@link prerenderRoutes} is what `scripts/prerender.ts` writes to disk, what `sitemap.xml` is
 *     generated from, and what the content regression test reads. Three consumers, one definition,
 *     so they cannot disagree about which pages exist. This mirrors `comparisonGrid()` in
 *     `catalog.ts`, which exists for the same reason and whose docblock argues the case.
 *   - {@link configFromPath} is the inverse, and it runs in the browser: the store reads it at
 *     import time so a visitor landing on `/rtx-5090/` gets the RTX 5090 rather than the default
 *     device. A separate parser would be a second definition of the same mapping and would drift
 *     from the first the day a route shape changed — and the failure would be silent, because an
 *     unparsed path falls back to the default scenario and simply shows the wrong machine.
 *
 * **A path is a lossy entry point; the querystring is the lossless encoding.** `Config` is nine
 * fields (`src/store/scenario.ts`) and `/<device>/<model>/` carries two; the rest come from
 * `DEFAULT_CONFIG`. That is the framing rather than a shortcoming, and it is what settles the
 * precedence rule stated on {@link configFromPath}: a query wins over a path, because the query
 * names an exact scenario and the path names *a scenario worth having a page for*.
 *
 * **No model id and no device id is written down here.** Every route derives from `DEVICES`,
 * `modelsByPopularity()` and the class counts below, so the pages the site publishes follow the
 * catalog on the next build rather than following whoever last remembered to edit this file. Phase
 * 2 kept three named device ids because no catalog-order rule produced the set it wanted; the tier
 * rules below supersede that shortlist, so the literals are gone.
 *
 * The `Config` import is type-only and therefore erased: nothing in `src/data/` depends on the
 * store at runtime, and the shape is the only thing the two genuinely share — the same reason
 * `scenario.ts` sits apart from both the store and the URL codec.
 */

/**
 * Which layer of the route inventory a page belongs to.
