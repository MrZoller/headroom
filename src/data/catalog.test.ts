   * **An Apple row's compute must be reproducible from a GPU core count the row itself states.**
   *
   * This is a convention test rather than a value test, and it exists because the same defect was
   * filed three times in one review round: a row identified by memory capacity while carrying the
   * compute of a GPU bin that capacity does not imply. The base MacBook Air at $999 has 8 GPU cores
   * and carried the 10-core rate; the 64 GiB M1 Max was offered as 24- and 32-core and carried the
   * 32-core rate; the 192 GiB M2 Ultra was offered as 60- and 76-core and carried the 76-core rate.
   * Each was a 25-33% overstatement of prefill on a machine somebody actually owns, and each was
   * invisible because no test connected the name to the number.
   *
   * Apple publishes no per-core figure, but within a generation it is constant — which is what makes
   * this checkable. `devices.json`'s own `$comment-compute` already states the rule ("Apple: FP32 at
   * 2x, from the per-GPU-core rate of that generation"); this asserts it.
   *
   * So every Apple row has to name its core count somewhere a reader will see it, and the arithmetic
   * has to come out. Rows whose capacity genuinely pins the bin (128 GiB only ever shipped with the
   * 40-core M4 Max) still state it, because "capacity implies it" is exactly the reasoning that was
   * wrong three times.

   * **A `cpu-ram` row's compute must be reproducible from a core count, a clock and an FMA width

   *
   * The same shape as the Apple check below, filed for the opposite reason. There, five rows shared
   * one correct rule and three of them applied it to the wrong bin. Here, five rows shared no rule
   * at all: each carried a figure conservative by a different unstated factor, and catalogued over
   * computed vector peak ran **0.41 to 1.12** across them — a 2.7x spread, which means the CPU rows
