/**
 * That a built page carries the figures — the regression guard #178 asks for by name.
 *
 * **Without this, a future change reverts the site to a shell and nothing says so.** That is not a
 * hypothetical class of bug, it is the state this issue was opened about: 860 bytes of
 * `<div id="root"></div>` served to every crawler while the app looked perfect in a browser. The
 * ways back are all silent — a render that throws inside a boundary, a store seam that stops
 * injecting, a substitution that stops matching — and every one of them writes a file of the right
 * name and roughly the right shape.
 *
 * **It composes the page rather than reading `dist/`, and that is deliberate.** CI runs
 * `npm test` *before* `npm run build`, so a test that read the built output would find nothing on a
 * fresh checkout — and the two ways around that are worse than composing here: skipping when
 * `dist/` is absent is a guard that silently does not run in the one place it is meant to, and
 * asserting against whatever `dist/` happens to hold makes a green suite depend on a build that may
 * be hours old. What is composed is the real thing on both sides: the shell is `index.html` as
 * committed, and the body is `renderRoute` over the real catalog and the real engine. `vite build`
 * changes the shell only by rewriting the script and stylesheet tags, and a shell that changed
 * shape enough to break a substitution fails the build loudly rather than passing here — the last
 * case below is that assertion.
 *
 * The browser half is `e2e/prerendered.spec.ts`, which loads a genuinely built page with
 * JavaScript disabled. Neither covers the other: this one passes on a page whose markup a browser
 * would never paint, and that one passes on a page composed from a shell nobody checked.
