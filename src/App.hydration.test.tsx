/**
 * That React actually *keeps* the prerendered markup.
 *
 * This is the silent failure of the whole mechanism (#178). A hydration mismatch makes React
 * throw the server's HTML away and re-render the tree from scratch: the page looks perfect in a
 * browser, every test that queries the DOM still passes, and the site is empty again to precisely
 * the crawlers and fetch tools prerendering exists for. Nothing about the built output shows it —
 * the HTML is there, it is simply discarded a few milliseconds after it arrives.
 *
 * React 19 routes every mismatch through `onRecoverableError`, so promoting that to a failure is
 * the assertion. The errors are also collected rather than only thrown, because a guard that
 * depends on an exception escaping React's internals is one refactor away from passing vacuously.
 *
 * **This is one of a pair and does not stand alone.** It passes on a page that was an empty shell
 * to begin with — what it checks is that the client agrees with the server, not that the server
 * produced anything. `entry-server.test.tsx` and `src/prerender/page.test.ts` are the other half,
 * asserting real per-device figures in the markup, and `e2e/prerendered.spec.ts` is the third:
 * a browser with JavaScript disabled, which is the one thing jsdom structurally cannot answer.

/**
 * One route per shape of tree, rather than all 199.
 *
 * **This swept every route while there were four, and the arithmetic stopped working at 199.** A
 * hydrate of the whole app costs ~65ms here and the CI runner is roughly 5x this machine, so the
 * full sweep is ~70s against a 30s per-test limit — and `vite.config.ts` argues at length that the
 * limit is not the thing to raise, because "a test approaching this is a test rendering the full
 * grid for a claim that does not need it". This is that case.
 *
 * **What it does not need is the product.** A mismatch is the client and the server disagreeing,
 * and both compute the tree from the same coerced `Config`; the one place they can diverge is the
 * path parse, and `routes.test.ts` round-trips all 199 of those in milliseconds. What is left for
 * this file is that each *shape* of tree hydrates — and shape is decided by the handful of fields
 * that switch a branch: the tier (which fields the route names at all), the device class (the
 * runtime filter, the quant fallback, the shard control), the device status (the pre-release
 * label), whether the ceiling is tunable (a second note and a different capacity verdict), and the
 * model's attention kind and MoE-ness (the quant applicability rules and the parameter breakdown).
 *
 * Derived rather than listed, so a catalog that grows a new combination gets covered without
 * anybody remembering to add it — which is the property a hand-picked sample would not have.
