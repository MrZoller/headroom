 * and its row-header column read from here rather than restating them. They had already drifted
 * three ways for one setting: the slider said "Concurrent users", the table header said "Users",
 * and the field's own y axis named it nowhere at all (#81).
 *
 * Same reasoning as `kvLabel` below, one level up: two surfaces naming one setting differently is
 * the failure this repo keeps hitting, and it is cheaper to remove than to remember. The four setup
 * settings are here for the same reason and not because a second surface reads them yet — the

 * coincidence today, exactly the coincidence recorded on `kvLabel`.

/**
 * What each measure is called, wherever a grid offers to colour itself by one.
 *
 * Both grids offer the same three — the Matrix over model × device, the Envelope over context ×
 * concurrent users since #65 — and they are the same three questions, so they are named once.
 * `KV_PRECISIONS` above is here for exactly the same reason: the options a control offers are
 * vocabulary, and a second hand-written copy is how two surfaces come to call one thing two things.
 *
 * `hint` is derived from `paints` rather than written beside it, because the two are the same
 * sentence in two registers: the toggle's caption states it as a heading would, and the picture's
 * `aria-label` needs it as a clause ("Coloured by tokens per second for one user"). Written twice,
 * a reworded caption leaves the screen-reader description describing the old colouring.
 *
 * **`ends` names what the two extremes of a ramp *are*, and deliberately not whether they are good.**
 * A ramp whose domain is the grid's own span cannot label its dark end "worse": on gpt-oss-20b at
 * llama.cpp/MXFP4 against an EPYC 9755 every one of the Envelope's 56 cells runs, the `fit` domain is
 * headroom 0.726 to 0.991, and the darkest step — the one `tokens.ts` calls "the one that recedes
 * into the panel" — lands on the 128K x 128-user corner, which still has 72.6% of a 1,450 GiB ceiling
 * free. "Worse" there is a claim about the machine; "less room" is a claim about the ramp, which is
 * all a rank-relative scale is entitled to say. Comparatives rather than superlatives for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * Per measure rather than one generic pair, because one of the three is inverted. `measureOf`
 * returns `1 / ttftSeconds` so that larger is better throughout, which makes a generic "least → most"
 * label read backwards against the caption beside it ("time until the first token appears"): a reader
 * would take the dark end for the *quick* one. The direction has to be spelled in the measure's own
 * units.
 *
 * The Matrix's ramp still says worse/better, and that is not drift: its domain is floored at zero
 * over a grid spanning a desktop CPU to a B200, so a dark cell there really is near the bottom of
 * what any hardware on the page achieves and a verdict word is a claim it can make. See the `fill`
 * comment in `Matrix.tsx` and `magnitudeFill` in `tokens.ts` for the two domains and why they differ.
 *
 * **The entries keep their literal types, so exhaustiveness can be checked below.**
 *
 * `satisfies` rather than a type annotation, and that distinction is the whole point (found in
 * review). Annotating the array `readonly { value: Measure; … }[]` widens each `value` to `Measure`,
 * so `(typeof MEASURES)[number]['value']` *is* `Measure` however few arms are listed — the check the
 * docblock on `measureVocabulary` claimed to be relying on could not fail. `satisfies` validates the
 * same shape while leaving `'fit' | 'decode' | 'ttft'` intact for `UncoveredMeasure` to subtract.

 * What each setting *means*, in one sentence, for the controls that have to say it themselves.

 * The five Usage controls are the whole KV-cache argument — context times users times bits per
 * token is most of what the budget bar draws — and the panel's entire text content at the default
 * scenario was the labels and the values: "Context per sequence 32K Concurrent users 1 …". The
 * relationship was stated in `Envelope.tsx`'s docstring, in a source comment, and on no surface a
 * reader can see. So was the coupling between the prompt and the context, and so was the fact that
 * KV precision is the same memory-for-quality trade `Quantization` makes for weights (#80).
 *
 * **Persistent text under the control, not a tooltip.** A native `title` needs a mouse and about a
 * second of dwell, does not exist on touch at all, and is invisible to a sighted keyboard user —
 * which is the defect #71 is open against on the Matrix, and taking the hover route here would walk
 * straight into it. `BudgetBar`'s hover-and-focus readout is the right pattern for *many* series
 * sharing *one* reserved line, where the text changes with what you point at; this is five controls
 * with one fixed sentence each, and a fixed sentence should simply be on screen. A disclosure was
 * the fallback and fails for the same reason in reverse: someone who does not know what "KV
 * precision" means does not know to open a disclosure about it.
 *
 * Keyed by `Config` field and kept beside the labels, because a setting's name and its
 * one-sentence explanation are the same vocabulary and drift the same way — this is the level
 * `SETTING_LABELS` already exists at.
 *
 * **Partial, deliberately, and in two different ways.** The four setup selects explain themselves
 * *per option* — the Hardware note is about the machine you picked, not about hardware — so a fixed
 * control-level sentence there would either duplicate or fight with the note that changes
 * underneath it. That is also why `Select`'s `hint` prop is gone rather than wired up here: it
 * rendered only when the selected option had no note of its own, so the explanation would appear
 * and vanish for a reason the reader cannot see.
 *
 * `deviceCount` is absent for the opposite reason: what an extra device *buys* is not a property of
 * the setting, it is a property of the setting and the runtime together, so it cannot be a constant
 * keyed by setting. It is `deviceCountNote` below. Every note in this table is true at every
 * scenario, which is the invariant that makes a table the right shape for them.
 *

 * offers. llama.cpp — the default runtime — and MLX both declare `parallelism: 'layer'`, and

 * decimal — 35.57 tok/s decode, 1438 tok/s prefill on a DGX Spark — and a sentence directly beneath
 * the slider credits an interconnect penalty against a bandwidth gain that was never evaluated.
 *
 * `docs/ROADMAP.md` records that derivation as one that was wrong first and is silent when it
 * breaks: "A layer split is not a speedup ... a single stream sees one card's bandwidth and one
 * card's FLOPS however many cards there are — that rig buys capacity, not speed." Putting the claim
 * back on screen is the same mistake one layer up, so the sentence reads `parallelism` for the same
 * reason the arithmetic does.
 *
 * A layer split can still make the page faster, and the note deliberately does not deny it: on a
 * 4090 at Q4_K_M this model decodes 14.25 tok/s spilling to host memory on one card and 190.11 on
 * four, because the fourth card is what stops it spilling. That is the capacity, arriving as speed.

 * `KvPrecision` is an internal width, not a name anyone types: vLLM's one-byte cache is FP8 with
 * no integer-Q8 option at all, so the catalog gives it a `kvLabels` entry and the control names
 * something the user could actually pass on a command line.
 *
 * One function because there were two resolutions and they disagreed about the fallback — the
 * Bench control read this table while the Matrix heading upper-cased the raw value. They agree on
 * all three current precisions by coincidence, and the first one whose display name is not its id
 * in capitals (`fp8_e5m2`, `q4_0`) would have had the two surfaces printing different names for
 * one setting. That is the failure this repo keeps hitting, and it is cheaper to remove than to
 * remember.
