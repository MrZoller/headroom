/**
 * Predicted versus measured (#139).
 *
 * The roofline is calibrated on two anchors — a DGX Spark on gpt-oss-20b and an EPYC 9654 on
 * DeepSeek-671B Q8 — and the ±30% band is asserted against them. This is the affordance that lets
 * anyone else check it: paste `llama-bench` output beside the prediction for the same scenario, see
 * both numbers, and optionally submit the pair through a pre-filled GitHub issue.
 *
 * Every competitor's numbers are rules of thumb; nobody can check them and nobody is asked to. A
 * public predicted-versus-measured record is the one argument that cannot be copied without the
 * community that feeds it.
 *
 * ## Parse, don't ask
 *
 * `llama-bench` emits markdown by default and JSON on `-o json`, and **JSON is strongly preferred
 * here** — it carries `build_commit`, which #139 names as the version-skew guard and which nothing
 * here checks (it is captured for the issue body, see {@link Measurement.buildCommit}), plus
 * `n_prompt`, `n_gen` and `n_depth` as numbers rather than as a string to re-parse. The markdown reader exists
 * because the default output is markdown and a reader who has already run the tool should not have
 * to run it again.
 *
 * The pasted text never leaves the page. The submission is a `github.com/…/issues/new` URL the
 * reader chooses to open, which is the same no-backend shape the weekly catalog refresh already
 * proved out.
 *
 * ## What a measurement has to carry before it means anything
 *
 * A measurement that cannot name its scenario is worth little to calibration, so {@link compare}
 * marks the ways that happens instead of reporting a delta against them. **{@link describeMismatch}
 * is that list, and this section deliberately does not restate it** — four rounds of #175 went on a
 * prose summary of that function which diverged from it in a different way each time, which is the
 * argument for a pointer over a paraphrase.
 *
 * The one property of it worth stating here, because it is easy to assume otherwise: **the checks on
 * the paste's own optional metadata fire only when the paste states the field.** llama-bench's
 * output is sparse and most of those fields are optional in it, so a JSON row carrying neither a
 * model name nor a cache type compares clean — the suite's own `JSON_OUTPUT` fixture is exactly that
 * row. Unstated is not rejected, except where a default makes silence itself a claim.
 *
 * That rule is about the measurement's fields and nothing else. The guards that read the
 * **prediction** — a configuration the engine refuses, a runtime `llama-bench` cannot measure, a
 * concurrency it cannot reproduce — fire whatever the paste contains, because there is no field in
 * it that could answer them.
 *
 * What this section is about is the four that are **invisible in the numbers**, because those are
 * the ones a reader can get wrong without noticing. **Two of them this module rejects; two it only
 * records** — a distinction worth keeping straight, since describing a recorded field as a check is
 * advertising a guard that does not exist (Codex spent two rounds on it in #175, and a third on
 * this paragraph reading as though the four were all of them).
 *
 * Rejected — marked, with no delta reported against them:
 *
 *   - **A different prompt length.** Prefill is quadratic in the prompt, so `pp512` against a
 *     prediction made at 16,384 tokens is not a disagreement about the model — it is two different
 *     jobs.
 *   - **A different depth.** `estimatePrefill` charges an agent turn's attention against a resident
 *     prefix, so a standalone `pp` run measures a different workload than the prediction. `-d` is
 *     what reproduces it, and `n_depth` is what says whether it was used.
 *
 * Recorded — nothing here compares them, because there is nothing to compare them against:
 *
 *   - **A different build.** A llama.cpp from six months ago is a different runtime for calibration
 *     purposes, and the catalog pins a runtime rather than a commit of one. `build_commit` is
 *     captured when the paste carries it and its absence is stated, for a human weighing the
 *     submission. See {@link Measurement.buildCommit}.
 *   - **A different machine.** `llama-bench` names the model file and the backend but not the host
 *     reliably, so the scenario URL is what ties a measurement to a device row — which is why the
 *     issue template makes that field non-optional.

/**
 * The default format.
 *
 * The table is `| model | size | params | backend | ngl | test | t/s |` *at its narrowest*, and the
 * middle of it is what varies: `llama-bench` prints a column for every setting that is not at its
 * default, in the order its own field list declares, between `backend` and `test`. So `type_k`,
 * `type_v`, `ts`, `threads`, `fa` and a dozen more appear and disappear per invocation — and a
 * parser that counts positions from either end is reading a different column on every one.
 *
 * **So the header row is read once and the columns without a distinctive shape are indexed by
 * name** (#181). Three fields want that. `type_k`/`type_v` were previously not read at all, so
 * every markdown paste was cache-unverifiable including the one the panel's own
 * `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -o md` produces with the columns printed. `ngl` was read by *position* — the
 * cell before `test` — on the theory that a bare integer has no shape to find it by, which is true
 * and is an argument for the header rather than for the position: those same cache columns sit
 * between `ngl` and `test`, as does the `ts` the multi-GPU command emits, so the panel's own output
 * was the case that broke it. Silently, and in the direction that matters — a lost `ngl` skips the
 * placement check entirely, so an offloaded run compared clean against a fully-resident prediction.
 * On a CPU paste it was worse than lost: `llama-bench` omits `ngl` for a CPU backend and prints
 * `threads`, so the cell before `test` was the thread count and a 96-thread EPYC run was marked as
 * 96 layers on a GPU it does not have.
 *
 * Everything else stays found by shape, because shape is the stronger identifier where one exists:
 * `params` is `8.03 B`, the backend is a bare alphabetic word, the rate carries the `±`. The header
 * is a fallback for the cells that have no shape, not a replacement for the cells that do.
 *
 * **A missing header is not a parse failure**, and neither is a header that does not fit. A reader
 * pasting one row out of a table has to keep working, so `ngl` falls back to the position it used
 * before and the cache columns stay unread — which is where both of them were. A header that lists
 * no `ngl`, which is every CPU-backend table, means the table has no `ngl`, and unstated is the
 * honest answer there; see `describeMismatch`, which checks the paste's optional fields only when
 * the paste states them.
 *
 * The `test` label has been spelled `pp 512`, `pp512` and `pp512 @ d512` across versions, so the
 * pattern tolerates the whitespace rather than pinning one spelling.
