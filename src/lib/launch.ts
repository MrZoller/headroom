/**
 * The runnable command for a placement (#136).
 *
 * Everything here is a formatter over answers the engine has already committed to — the layer
 * assignment, the KV precision, the context, the shard count. What it is *not* is a second
 * derivation of any of them: `-ngl` reads `Placement.assignment.residentLayers`, `--max-model-len`
 * reads the same `contextTokens` the budget bar drew, and where a figure is not on the placement
 * it is not printed. A limit stated twice is a limit that will disagree with itself, and here the
 * disagreement would be copy-pasteable.
 *
 * ## The three refusals, and why a refusal is the feature
 *
 * A command is a claim that something can be run, so this module refuses more often than it emits:
 *
 *   1. **A configuration the engine turned away.** `unsupported` and `impossible` both describe a
 *      placement that does not exist, and a command for one is a command that OOMs on load.
 *   2. **A checkpoint the catalog cannot name.** `ModelSpec.id` is the *source* repo, and
 *      `QuantSpec` carries sizing and compute properties only — there is no GGUF, AWQ or MLX
 *      artifact anywhere in the data. So a Q4_K_M selection under vLLM has no repo to print, and
 *      naming the source checkpoint instead would be a command for a different model than the one
 *      the placement priced. See {@link artifactFor}.
 *   3. **A format the runtime does not actually load.** The #18 substitution: MLX's figures at
 *      Q4_K_M derive from a format MLX cannot read, so a command naming that checkpoint is a
 *      command for a file that does not exist. `substitutionFor` already knows; this refuses on it.
 *
 * ## Every flag was read from upstream, and each template says where
 *
 * "A command is a claim, and flags drift" is the trap #136 names, and every template below carries
 * a `source` and the date it was checked, in the posture `devices.json` takes for a device spec.
 * Four things in here are *not* what a from-memory implementation would have written, and each one
 * was found by reading the source rather than by recalling it:
 *
 *   - **llama.cpp's `-ngl` counts the output tensor.** `n_gpu_layers` is the repeating blocks plus
 *     one position, so a fully-resident 48-layer model wants `-ngl 49`, and `-ngl 48` sheds *layer
 *     0* rather than the output tensor — the window comes off the front of the stack. It is one
 *     rule and not a rule for resident placements: the slot exists for any positive `-ngl`, so a
 *     spilling placement of `N` layers is `-ngl N + 1` too. See {@link gpuLayers}.
 *   - **`-ts` is normalised over that same window, so its ratios have to sum to `-ngl`.** The
 *     cumulative shares are compared against `(il - i_gpu_start) / act_gpu_layers` and
 *     `act_gpu_layers` is `min(ngl, n_layer_all + 1)` — so ratios summing to the repeating layers
 *     alone are stretched across one slot more than they describe, and the first card silently
 *     gains a layer. The output slot rides on the last share — the bin `planPlacement` seeded with
 *     the output projection — and is emitted as part of it. See {@link tensorSplit}.
 *   - **`-c` is the whole cache, divided among the `-np` slots.** `n_ctx_seq` is
 *     `n_ctx / n_seq_max` unless the KV buffer is unified, so eight users at 64K wants `-c 524288`.
 *     Passing the per-user figure would give each slot an eighth of it.
 *   - **Ollama's Modelfile has no `num_gpu` parameter.** The documented list is `num_ctx`,
 *     `num_predict` and the sampler knobs — so the layer split this feature exists to print is the
 *     one thing that surface cannot take, and the template says so rather than inventing a flag.
 *   - **`mlx_lm.server` has no KV quantization flag.** `--kv-bits` is on `mlx_lm.generate`; the
 *     server's argument list does not carry it, so an 8-bit-cache scenario cannot be served at the
 *     precision it was priced at.
 *   - **`-ot`/`--override-tensor` moves a layer's weights and not its cache**, which is why there
 *     is no per-layer placement flag here and why #166 closes with a sentence rather than a
 *     command. See {@link packingNotes} for the read.
 *
 * A fourth kind of refusal is deliberately not on the list of three, because it is a property of
 * the *surface* rather than of the placement: `mlx_lm.server` has no cache-precision flag, and
 * Ollama's Modelfile has no parallelism parameter. Each turns away its own serving form for a
 * scenario the panel still answers — a sibling launcher for Ollama, since `llama-server` takes both
 * as flags, and the launcher's own measurement form for MLX, since `mlx_lm.generate` does take
 * `--kv-bits`. See {@link mlx} and {@link ollama}.

 * `-ngl`, one rule: the resident layer count plus the output tensor's slot.
 *
 * Two corrections sit between `assignment.residentLayers` and the flag, and the engine declines
 * both because it has no notion of a flag:
 *
 *   - **A CPU-only rig offloads nothing.** `residentLayers` reports every layer, truthfully —
 *     nothing spilled, because there was nowhere to spill *from*. The honest flag is 0.
 *   - **llama.cpp counts the output tensor one position past the repeating blocks.**
 *     `n_gpu_layers` defaults to `n_layer_all + 1`, and `i_gpu_start = max(n_layer_all + 1 - ngl, 0)`
 *     — so "all of them" is `layers + 1`, and `-ngl 48` on a 48-layer model is one short: it sheds
 *     **layer 0**, at the front of the stack, and keeps the output tensor. The output tensor is slot
 *     `n_layer_all`, and `il - i_gpu_start = ngl - 1 < act_gpu_layers = ngl` holds there for every
 *     `ngl >= 1`, so it is on a GPU whenever anything is; upstream's own fitter says "the last device
 *     has the output layer, which cannot be a partial layer". Read 5 August 2026 from
 *     `src/llama-model.cpp:1318-1343` and `common/fit.cpp:581` at ggml-org/llama.cpp commit
 *     `360e134` (#202).
 *
 * **The `+ 1` used to be applied only where nothing spilled**, and that was #204's first defect: a
 * spilling `-ngl N` loaded `N - 1` repeating layers plus the table rather than the `N` the panel
 * priced. Measured over 361,200 catalog configurations (35 models x llama.cpp's eight weight
 * formats x 43 devices x {1,2,4,5,8} cards x {8K,32K,128K} x {1,4} users), 218,334 of which emit a
 * command: **56,719 of them were off by one, and 1,537 were `-ngl 1` loading no repeating layer at
 * all.** `Math.min(residentLayers, model.layers) + 1` collapses the two branches into the one rule
 * upstream actually has. The clamp is defensive — under a layer split `residentLayers` is a sum
 * bounded by the model's own count — and it is what keeps the flag from claiming a slot that does
 * not exist if that ever stops holding.
 *
 * **Zero is deliberately still zero, and it is the one case #204 left open.** Where
 * `residentLayers` floors to zero on a GPU rig the rule above would emit `-ngl 1`, which puts the
 * whole output table on the card and no repeating layer. Whether that is honest varies across the
 * range it fires on: `residentLayers` floors, so it reaches zero while a real fraction of the
 * weights is still resident — 74.6% to 99.9% of the rig spilling across the 5,807 configurations
 * that reach it in the sweep above, and never 100%. Near the low end the resident remainder is
 * roughly the fixed block and the table is close to the right thing to keep; near the high end
 * nothing meaningful is resident and offloading the whole table over-offloads relative to what was
 * priced. `placementRefusal` already turns away 17,464 of the 23,271 zero-resident GPU
 * configurations, so the open question is where that boundary belongs rather than whether to build
 * one — and it is not answered by an off-by-one fix. Left as it was so this change moves only what

 * `-ts`, whenever llama.cpp's default could choose a different split.
 *
 * This is the one flag that exists *because* the assignment was surfaced. llama.cpp's default split
 * is proportional to each device's memory, which on a homogeneous rig is an equal number of layers —
 * and on a hybrid model that is the wrong split, because one full-attention layer caches up to
 * ~128x what a sliding one does. `layerSplitBins` balances the combined load instead, and on Gemma
 * 3 12B at 128K over five cards its layer counts land 19 apart.
 *
 * **The counts are the *resident* ones, not the assigned ones, and the first version of this
 * emitted the assigned ones** — which is the trap #136 names, reached from the far side. `-ts` does
 * not distribute the model; it distributes the `-ngl` window, because llama.cpp puts the last `ngl`
 * layers on GPUs and splits *those* by these proportions. So `-ngl` and `-ts` are read together,
 * and giving them counts from two different scopes lets llama.cpp re-derive a per-device split that
 * is neither.
 *
 * It is reachable and it OOMs. Ministral 3 3B at Q8_0, 131,072 tokens over 4 users on four RTX
 * 5080s packs 7,7,6,6 layers and keeps 2,2,6,6 of them resident — so `-ngl 16 -ts 7,7,6,6` asks
 * llama.cpp to spread sixteen layers slightly-in-favour-of the two cards Headroom sized for two, which
 * are the constrained cards precisely because their cache already fills them. `2,2,6,6` is the
 * split that was actually sized.
 *
 * Where nothing spills the two are identical, so this changes only the case it exists for.
 *
 * ## The window has one more slot than the split describes, and that is what {@link ratios} is for
 *
 * `-ts` proportions the `-ngl` window, and the window is `act_gpu_layers = min(ngl, L + 1)` slots
 * — the repeating layers **and the output tensor's own position**. llama.cpp normalises the ratios
 * by their own sum and then compares the cumulative shares against `(il - i_gpu_start) /
 * act_gpu_layers`, so ratios summing to `L` are stretched across `L + 1` positions and device 0's
 * boundary lands at `c0/L` against a key stepping in `1/(L + 1)`: **the first card gains a slot
 * whenever its cumulative share is at least one.** Worked, and confirmed against a port of
 * `llama-model.cpp:1285-1343` at commit `360e134`: 32 layers, `-ngl 33 -ts 7,7,6,6,6` delivers
 * `8,7,6,6,5` with the output on the last card. Every one of the 42,037 `-ts`-emitting
 * configurations in the sweep {@link gpuLayers} describes was wrong this way — 100% of them, and
 * the first card gained the slot on 39,736; the rest lead with a zero share, which cannot gain.
 *
 * **The correction is to emit the output's slot rather than to leave it implicit**: `+1` on one
 * share, and `-ngl` reads `residentLayers + 1` from {@link gpuLayers}. The two then agree by
 * construction — the ratios sum to `-ngl` — and the arithmetic collapses: with `act_gpu_layers`
 * equal to the ratio sum, key `k / sum` against boundary `c_i / sum` assigns slot `k` to the first
 * device with `c_i > k`, so device `i` gets exactly `ratio_i` slots and the share carrying the `+1`
 * spends its extra slot on the output. Every one of the 42,037 delivers the packed layer counts on
 * the packed cards (#204). *Which* share carries the `+1` is the next section, and #204 got it
 * wrong.
 *
 * ## The extra slot goes to the seeded bin whatever its layer count, and "last non-zero" did not
 *
 * #204 gave the slot to the last share **with a layer on it**, reasoning that a card with no share
 * of the window cannot be handed the table. That reads as the careful choice and it is the defect:
 * `planPlacement` charges `outputBytes` to the bin it *seeded*, which is the last one, and the
 * seeded bin is systematically the first to floor to zero resident layers — `spilledOf` clamps a
 * bin's overflow to `weightBytes`, which carries the output block, while `residentLayersOf` divides
 * that overflow by `layerWeightBytes`, which does not. So the one bin holding an extra fixed block
 * loses its layers first, and the moment it does, "last non-zero" points at a different card from
 * the one the panel priced the table onto: the flag puts the output table on a card that was never
 * sized for it, while the card that was sits idle. Measured over the shipped catalog — 35
 * models x 12 formats x the 25 discrete GPUs x {2,3,4,5,8} cards x {8K,32K,128K} x {1,4} users —
 * 1,801 placements diverge and 1,055 of them emit a `-ts`, at offload fractions from 39.0% to
 * 97.8%. `layerSplitBins`'s zero-layer suppression cannot see any of it: that guard runs before the
 * ceiling is known and it guards *assigned* layers, not resident ones.
 *
 * A zero share is legal, so the fix is to stop treating it as a special case. The seeded bin's
 * ratio is `c + 1 >= 1` whatever `c` is, so its cumulative boundary is the only one that exceeds
 * the final slot's key and the output lands there by the same `upper_bound` as everything else.
 * Confirmed against the port in `launch.test.ts`: `-ngl 2 -ts 1,1` delivers `[1,0]` layers with the
 * output on card 1, and `-ngl 3 -ts 1,1,0,1` delivers `[1,1,0,0]` with the output on card 3.
 *
 * **An even resident split still needs the flag** (#207). It describes `L` repeating layers, while
 * llama.cpp distributes the `L + 1`-slot window that also contains the output tensor. If `n`
 * devices divide `L` evenly, they cannot divide `L + 1`; the default must put the remainder on a
 * different card from the seeded output bin. The default is also based on *current free memory*, so
 * even nominally identical cards are not a reproducible substitute for the explicit ratios.
 *
 * Re-measured 16 August 2026 against the current 35-model, 43-device catalog after #182/#209 changed
 * the packing: of 361,200 configurations, 235,819 reach a runnable command and 59,590 reach the old
 * equal-resident-count suppression gate (34,621 fully resident and 24,969 spilling). Current
 * llama.cpp still normalises free-memory shares over `min(ngl, L + 1)` and selects with strict
 * `upper_bound`; read from `src/llama-model.cpp:1317-1359` at commit `ad1de39e`. Every expressible
 * multi-device window therefore gets `-ts`, including those whose repeating-layer counts are even.
 *
 * **And never where the layers cache different amounts, which is the case the flag looked most
 * useful for** (raised by Codex on #164, P1). `-ts` partitions llama.cpp's ordered `-ngl` suffix
 * into contiguous device ranges; `layerSplitBins` assigns *individual* layers by greedy combined
 * load, so a share can be a non-contiguous mixture of full-attention and sliding layers. Where
 * those cache ~128x differently, equal counts do not reproduce equal loads — llama.cpp would hand a
 * card a different set of expensive layers than `planPlacement` priced, and the fit the panel
 * reported would not be the fit the command produces. A count is a faithful description of the
 * packing only where the layers are interchangeable, so that is the only place it is emitted.
 *
 * **The gate is `layersCacheAlike`, not `hasSlidingLayers`, and the difference is a scenario the
 * model-level question gets wrong.** Being hybrid is a property of the model; caching *unequal
 * amounts* is a property of the context. Below its shortest window a hybrid model's layers all hold
 * the whole context, so the packing hands out equal loads and the flag is exact — Gemma at a
 * 1,024-token context was refused the flag it could have had, and told why in terms of an imbalance
 * that does not exist there.
 *
 * What remains is still worth having: wherever layers cache alike, their packed counts describe the
 * contiguous ranges exactly, and explicit ratios keep llama.cpp from re-deriving another placement.

/**
 * What Headroom packed, said out loud on the rigs `-ts` has to refuse (#166).
 *
 * `tensorSplit` declines wherever the layers do not cache alike, because a count is a faithful
 * description of a greedy per-layer packing only where the layers are interchangeable. Declining
 * is right and it is not the whole answer: leaving the flag off does not make llama.cpp reproduce
 * the assignment, it makes llama.cpp pick a different one — so on precisely the scenarios where the
 * packing is worth the most, the panel computed a better split than it could express and described
 * it as "more than the panel above shows".
 *
 * It can now say which layers, because `DeviceShare.layerIndices` carries them. That is the whole
 * of what #166 asked the engine for, and it is what makes these two sentences quantitative: the
 * counts and the *composition* are two different lists, and the panel had only ever been able to
 * print the one that does not carry the load.
 *
 * ## Why there is no flag to emit instead, which is the part that was worth reading upstream for
 *
 * #166 hoped for `-ot`/`--override-tensor`, since it takes a pattern and a buffer type and can
 * name individual tensors — so a per-layer override list looks expressible in principle. It is
 * not, and the reason is one level below the flag:
 *
 *   - `llama_model::load_tensors` computes `dev_layer[il]` from `n_gpu_layers` and `tensor_split`
 *     alone — `i_gpu_start = max(n_layer_all + 1 - n_gpu_layers, 0)`, then an `upper_bound` over
 *     the normalised splits — **before** any override is consulted.
 *   - The overrides are applied later, in `llama_model_loader::create_tensor`, by
 *     `std::regex_search` against a *tensor* name. They change where a weight lives and nothing
 *     else.
 *   - `llama_kv_cache`'s constructor takes each layer's cache buffer from
 *     `ggml_backend_dev_buffer_type(model.dev_layer(il))`.
 *
 * So `-ot` would move a layer's weights to the card Headroom chose and leave its KV cache on the card
 * `-ngl`/`-ts` chose. On a hybrid model the cache is the entire reason the packing is uneven — the
 * per-layer weights are uniform and a full-attention layer caches up to ~128x a sliding one at
 * 128K — so the flag moves the half that does not vary and leaves the half that does. A command
 * built from it would start a placement other than the one the panel priced, which is the first of
 * this module's three refusals rather than a caveat to print beside it.
 *
 * Read on 2 August 2026 from `src/llama-model.cpp`, `src/llama-model-loader.cpp` and
 * `src/llama-kv-cache.cpp` at ggml-org/llama.cpp master.

/**
 * Where the tensors no layer holds actually go, and the two flags that move them (#182).
 *
 * The engine takes the input embedding table off a discrete GPU's budget entirely, because
 * llama.cpp pins it to the host — `llama-model.cpp:1333-1335`, *"there is very little benefit to
 * offloading the input layer, so always keep it on the CPU"*, with no `-ngl`, `-sm` or `-ts` input
 * to the decision. On an untied model that is a whole `vocab x hidden` table the cards used to be
 * charged for.
 *
 * **It moves answers optimistically, which is why the caveats are printed rather than filed in a
 * docblock.** Fifty-five thousand of the catalog's single-card configurations get lighter and 174
 * of them cross from "will not run" to "fits" — Qwen3 14B at Q5_K_M on a 5080 at 32K goes from
 * 15.39 to 14.87 GiB against a 15.00 GiB ceiling. A reader acting on that has bought the card. So
 * the two conditions under which the accounting is not what the panel priced are stated beside the
 * command a reader is about to run:
 *
 *   - **`-sm row`** splits the output projection across cards rather than holding it whole on the
 *     last one. Every placement here is `-sm layer`, llama.cpp's default, and "the block sits on

 * spends almost every token it emits near the top of it. So the state to reproduce is a nearly-full
 * cache, and `-d` is the flag that produces it.
 *
 * **The length is not the interesting half, and asking for the window's whole remainder was the
 * defect** (#180). Decode is a steady-state per-token rate — the same fact `describeMismatch` relies
 * on when it declines to check a decode run's length at all — so how many tokens you ask for does
 * not move the number, while the cache each of them reads does. The first version handed `-n` the
 * entire remainder: 24,576 tokens on the default scenario, which at the predicted 35.6 tok/s is 11.5
 * minutes of generation per repetition and llama-bench repeats five times by default. It also put
 * the cache at `prompt + prefix` — 8,192 against a figure charged at 32,768 — so the row the panel
 * told a reader to produce was one `compare` rejected.
 *
 * **What that cost the calibration record was decode points rather than correct ones**, and the two
 * are worth telling apart: `submissionUrl` writes only the pairs `compare` did *not* reject, so a
 * biased decode row could never have reached the corpus that feeds the next retune of
 * `bandwidthEfficiency`. It is the rows that got through that were the problem. `prompt + prefix`
 * lands inside the tolerance exactly when the prompt already nearly fills the window, so the only
 * scenarios the panel's own path could contribute a decode measurement from were the ones with
 * almost nothing left to generate — a narrow slice, selected on the axis being calibrated, and
 * shallow within it.
 *
 * **`gen` is llama-bench's own default of 128, held to a sixteenth of the window**, and the ceiling
 * is what makes the emitted command acceptable rather than merely quick. `describeMismatch` marks a
 * decode row whose depth is more than 10% off the context the prediction charges, and the depth here
 * is `contextTokens - gen`, so `gen` has to stay inside a tenth of the window at *every* context a
 * reader can reach — not just the default. The fixed stops start at 2,048 and 128/2,048 is exactly a
 * sixteenth, so the clamp never binds at a stop and 128 is what an ordinary scenario measures; below
 * the smallest stop — which no control offers, and which a hand-edited link reaches down to the 512
 * floor `coerce` clamps at — it keeps the ratio instead, since a flat 128 there is a quarter of the
 * window and would be rejected.
 *
 * The relation is a ratio and not a shared constant, which is why this returns a pair rather than
 * exporting a number for both sides to use: the cache grows as the run generates, so the depth the
 * measurement actually averages over is `contextTokens - gen / 2` — inside the ceiling by another
 * factor of two, and still not the `contextTokens` the engine charges. `calibrate.test.ts` pins that

 * The `-ts` sentence, which has to state both readings because the flag shows only one.

 * the panel is least able to check. Saying which card the table lands on is the other half: it is
 * the reason that share is larger, and it is a placement fact `-ts` is otherwise silent about.
 *
 * **The card holding the table can hold nothing else**, which is why that clause has two forms. The
