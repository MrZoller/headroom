/**
 * The Setup panel's geometry, once a picker note stops being a page of prose. Issue #68.
 *
 * The Hardware note was `[statusWarning, ceilingClause, row.note].join(' ')` — up to 180 words of
 * catalog provenance under a `<select>` at `text-xs`. The issue's own "side effect worth noting" is
 * what that does to a two-column grid: the Hardware cell sets the height of the row it shares with
 * Model, so a note that wraps to ten or eleven lines pushes the Quantization/Runtime row down and
 * leaves the same amount of empty space under Model. The prose now lives behind a disclosure.
 *
 * **Why this is here and not in Vitest.** Every number below is a line box or a laid-out rectangle:
 * jsdom has no layout engine, `getClientRects()` returns nothing, and every assertion would be a
 * tautology. Whether the derivation is *reachable* and whether it is in `aria-describedby` are DOM
 * questions and are asserted in `src/App.test.tsx`; how many lines it occupies is not.
 *
 * The assertions are deliberately relative — a line count, and a before/after on the same page — so
 * they state the property rather than a font metric. An absolute pixel budget would be measuring
 * Chrome's text shaping.
