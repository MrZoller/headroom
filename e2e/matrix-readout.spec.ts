 * The readout under the comparison grid, and the only question about it jsdom cannot answer.
 *
 * Every figure the grid computes used to live in a native `title` (#71), so a sighted keyboard user
 * arrowing a row got the colour and nothing else. The fix is a reserved line under the grid that
 * fills on hover *and* on focus — and the word doing the work is **reserved**. A line that appears
 * when it has something to say reflows whatever sits under it on every move between two cells, and if
 * the line were above the grid it would reflow the cells themselves: the square under the pointer
 * moves as the readout describes it, which is a hover trap rather than a readout.
 *
 * Which string the line holds, when it fills and when it clears is DOM, and `App.test.tsx` pins all
 * of it in a second — including the pointer half, via synthetic mouse events. What no unit test can
 * see is whether `min-h` is worth a line of height and whether a filled line leaves the geometry
 * where it was: jsdom has no layout engine, so every rect below reads 0 there and every assertion
 * would be a tautology. That is the split this directory exists for.

 * those five controls to the top of the page, *above* the grid — which would have left this test
 * asserting that a panel upstream of the readout does not move when the readout grows. That is true
 * of any markup at all, including markup with the reservation deleted: a passing geometry assertion
 * measuring nothing, which this repo has now had to unpick three times.
 *

 * own height**, which is where the growth would be, and the **document's height**, which is every
