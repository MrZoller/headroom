/**
 * That a browser with JavaScript switched off paints the figures — the half of #178 nothing else
 * can answer.
 *
 * The unit suite has two guards and neither reaches this. `src/prerender/page.test.ts` asserts the
 * composed HTML carries the numbers, which passes on markup a browser would never paint.
 * `src/App.hydration.test.tsx` asserts React keeps that markup, which passes on a page that was an
 * empty shell to begin with. What is left is the question the issue was opened about — what a
 * client that does not execute the bundle actually gets — and jsdom cannot answer it, because
 * jsdom has no rendering at all.
 *
 * **Two assertions per route, because either one alone is satisfiable by the wrong thing.** The
 * served bytes are fetched and matched, which is what a crawler sees and cannot be produced by the
 * app running; and the painted element is measured, which is what a reader sees and cannot be
 * produced by markup that is present but clipped to nothing. `toBeVisible()` is deliberately not
 * the second one: Playwright calls a 1px `sr-only` box visible, and this repo has already shipped
 * a test that passed on hidden text for exactly that reason (see ROADMAP, Tests).
 *
 * **This must not be used to prove the 404 fallback.** `playwright.config.ts` serves from
 * `vite preview`, which SPA-falls-back on an unknown path where GitHub Pages hard-404s — so every
 * route here is one the build genuinely wrote, and the fallback is checked against `dist/` on disk
 * at the bottom of this file instead.
